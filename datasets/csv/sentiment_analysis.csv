Playing around with makeup is an outlet for me because I'm already stuck in the house 95% of the time anyway, due to an illness.

Out of the 5 or 6 products I would regularly buy in there, they now carry zero. If you're an introvert that just likes to be able to grab what you need and leave, this is definitely no longer the store for you. The layout now seems to be set up to force you to ask for help.

Not one of them greeted me said ""Hello welcome to Ulta"" or asked if I needed help or anything they all were very smug and continued there conversations. This location has to be the most dirty Ulta that I have ever been in. ALL testers were filthy and not wiped down, the inside and outside of the pallets are just nasty smashed ,crushed and messed over. The outside of the pallets have all kinds of mess on them obviously they dont maintain them. Also a lot of the pallets were not even properly attached to the display  barley touching it it fell off... touch the pallet next to it.. they both fall off.. especially in the Tart cosmetics section it was a mess. All of the lip sticks were smashed and running down the jar it did not look sanitary or properly maintained. If you did take a sample or a swotch of a color there were no wipes to clean your hands ex.. the clean up sections were not properly stocked. The isles were unorganized and had products on the floor in the hair care area. Make up storage boxed that are $60 + strung out on the floor with brushes and what not. The entire time I was in the store not one employee greeted or asked if I needed help finding anything they were very unwelcoming and uninviting and had a dont bother me vibe.  I will not be returning to this location of Ulta beauty.  I go to the location in River chase and theres is perfect friendly, clean and welcoming so I know what to expect from the franchise.  Midtown village location is not hitting the mark. Also the store needs a good airing out because the perfume testing smells were so over powering it hit me like a truck the second I entered the store. It was distracting and over whelming how it felt stuffy as if there is no air circulation in the store and smelled of stale perfume samples all mixed together with thick air. Which the other Ulta locations I have visited do not have this problem. The store did  not have a clean sleek environment that Ulta is known for. Non of the products were properly fronted on the shelf for easy and clear access. I had to keep checking to make sure the correct pallet was sitting in the proper spot and most of the time they were not. Everything was jumbled around not in its proper place not properly fronted for easy viewing. At the end of it all the store was such a mess I just left.

There items were ulta beauty items so nothing that should have been hard to find. Instead of the employee trying to help me find the item she asked me if I needed help but in a confrontational way, like the thought I was stealing. I was taken back by the attitude so I told her no, that they did not seem to have what I needed. As I kept looking through the store she purposely inserted herself in my way, walking in between me and the item I was looking at, talking to someone standing on the other side of me. I left without buying anything since I felt so berated by the employee.i might never go back. *Note went to saphora after and was helped by a great employee and got everything I needed.

Michael was personable and I enjoyed talking with him while he cut my hair. Jennifer was the other stylist there and the atmosphere was relaxed. I had a 10:30 am appointment and was done at 11:30.

I did get a good haircut but the stylist decided to curl my hair afterwards without telling me that it would cost $15 extra. She did not ask if I wanted it curled and just went ahead and did it and charged me for it. Imagine my surprise when I got the bill for a $70 haircut. It came off to me as very unprofessional and I didn't appreciate the lack of transparency and lack of communication. Every other salon I've been to communicates when a service costs extra and asks before doing anything that would be an additional cost.

It was my first time ever having salon services done at ULTA, and I am beyond thrilled with the results! Nicole was my stylist (she's listed as Jacqueline if you make an appointment online), and she was AMAZING!! She did a very thorough consultation with me before we started to determine the look I was wanting and map out the best way to achieve it. She explained different processes and their end results to me, and knowledgeably answered the questions I asked. We ended up going with all-over color, full highlights, and the haircut/deep conditioner/style combo. She was extremely professional and obviously very confident in her skills which allowed me to relax and fully enjoy the whole salon experience. The services I had done take a few hours, but Nicole was so engaging and attentive that the time just flew by! And the finished product was simply breathtaking, no exaggeration. So I absolutely, 100% recommend The Salon at ULTA Beauty; the stylists there are all clearly top notch. But if Nicole is available, do yourself a huge favor and book with her.

When I got there the lady at the register said she was running behind and would page me when she was ready. I heard my name called so I went to the front desk. But I think the lady was on her way out so she just told me to have a set in a chair. Their was hair still all over the floor from the last person but she still had me sit there. Mohan washed my hair and started the hair cut. She didn't talk much and disnt ask if the cut in the back was to short. ""It was"" she straightened my hair to finnishe the cut. She didnt really style it at all. When I got to the register to pay she said it would be 66. But online it said 55. And their was a sign that said 1st time customers get 20% off there hair cut. But she said straightening my hair cost extra. But no one told me that. She never said anything. So she called a manager up. But the hair salon manger left for the day. So this lady had no idea what was going on. Monah took off the 11 is cost to straighten my hair and told me that someone should have told me before the hair cut that it was extra. She didnt give me 20% off and acted like she did me a favor by taking off the 11 dollars. It was just a bad experience. I will not go back there.",2018,AK,Alaska,61.2297133,-149.7365987,G,8,0

After a few minutes of looking at the colourpop stuff one of the employees literally yells at another lady for touching the display makeup. Like just all the sudden yelling. Literally startled me it was so quiet and all you here is a banshee yelling at this poor lady just because she has to clean a few makeup items. Other service workers like myself have to clean a lot more than you boo. After my first trip I actually had to come back in because I forgot moisturizer. So I go to the Clinique stuff and there’s a box of different stuff. The TAG says suggested retail price is 39.30. But the price on the SHELF said 22 dollars. The lady working there would not believe me nor would she honor that price even tho there was more than one box there it’s not like they were put in the wrong spot. So point is the female employees like to scream like banshees at customers and then argue with them and not honor their prices.

I've come in morning, noon, and night, even with my husband (I never do such a thing to him) and service has been consistently awesome!

Not trying to bash on the other locations but the customer service overall is much better than others I've visited. The staff was all very nice and welcoming, I was able to get expert advice on hair and make-up products with the help of their Master Stylist, Heather, who was an absolute doll to work with. She was very welcoming, bubbly, honest and kind. I appreciated that she didn't judge what I needed based on how I looked. Money is never an option for me and sometimes I don't dress to impress so I appreciate not being treated like I'm afraid to spend money.

I also liked that I was asked by at least 3 other gals, all of whom were doing something while asking if I needed any assistance and all looked ready to jump at the opportunity. All the ladies I talked to knew where the product was, didn't seem bothered by my questions, and were oh so ready to help me out. The store was very clean and organized, and all the ladies working this morning seemed to be in very good moods. I loved how active they were on the floor, most other locations I frequent, its almost impossible to find someone to help you out and when you do they almost always seem annoyed or bothered.

Luckily, there was a fantastic esthetician working in the salon because no one was scheduled to work the brow bar for the day. Got a quick wax and grabbed a few other products. When I went to check out my email coupons wouldn’t pull up and the cashier wouldn’t honor the coupon I was showing her. All she could say was “yeah, we have horrible service here.” Make sure to print out your coupons before hand or have them saved to your phone.

The only reason why this review got 3 stars is because of the esthetician working in the salon. I was not greeted when walking in and never asked if I needed help while looking at other products.

With bp issues associated with Lupus, it is not good for me to stand still for long periods, or it causes fainting.  It has happened.  So I keep my legs moving while waiting and watching floor sales just wander around pretending they did not see the line of customers waiting.  I finally got in line and waited another 15 minutes behind the same girl I was behind when I decided to move my legs a bit.  That's right.  She hadn't moved an inch.  Customers talking to the only checker we're not helping her out, I'm sure.  She was the ONLY worker I saw actually working.  I absolutely felt bad for her.  Finally a second lady (who pretended to be surprised, or maybe she was, since all workers were just messing around in the store gabbing with each other, so maybe she was geniunely surprised to see there was an actual line and no extra checkers.  She offered to check me out, and I thanked her because she was the only one to offer to help the initial checker.  The fact that they were the only store in Brighton to carry eyebrow shaper as well as ONE highlight kit, I had no choice but to wait it out which I am fairly patient but that was completely avoidable to not have a 30 minute wait with what I counted as 4 employees doing nothing while 2 checked customers out, one coming a half an hour into the wait.  I wish customer service still existed.  Sadly it's a thing of the past.  I like Ulta but the employees seem like they do not care about your time or your comfort in the insanely lengthy lines.
Edited to add: I agree with other customer reviews about them following you around.  It feels like being stalked.  I don't know if it's a ""steal"" thing like some have considered, but like they make commission or something and just harrass you.  Today, I did not have that issue on the floor as they were busy yapping gossip with each other.  Which I'd rather them gossip than harass me while I shop.  But it's funny that they give so much attention on the floor and then completely ignore you in the checkout lines.",2018,CO,Colorado,39.9545857,-104.7821747,G,5,0

I don’t know much about hair, so I showed her 3 pics of what I wanted (two were of me from a few years ago) which was to cut off the split ends, remove length, and have side swept bangs.

There were a few times where there was a phone call or someone at the desk, which I know she had to address, but she didn’t even say anything, just kind of walked away each time.

She ended up not touching my bangs at all, even though they were crazy long, and didn’t style a side swept bang at all. Also, she didn’t cut much length off. (When she said I was “all done” I had her fix those issues, though)

She asked if I wanted my hair flat ironed, and I said sure! As I was paying at the front I realized that she charged me for it. She never told me if it would be any cost, just asked if I wanted it.

The woman at the front desk (a manager, I think) was very apologetic, and gave me a sample face cream for the flat iron issue.

I can’t say this is the best haircut I’ve ever had. It was ok, in the end. She ended up thinning my already somewhat thin hair out, which sucks.

I’ve been to the north haven one before, though, and had no problems. I probably won’t be coming back to this Ulta, which sucks because it’s much closer to where I live now.",2019,CT,Connecticut,41.5511611,-72.8076036,G,5,0

A comment about Ulta in general is their heavy push to register for their rewards program which holds up the line at the register. Ulta generally doesn't do a good job of staffing the registers and I always have to wait. I never have to wait at Sephora and Sephora always gives samples while Ulta never does.

She declined and the same 2 employees then rang out and pitched the same offer to the woman in front of me. She decided to take the offer so 1 of the employees came around the counter with a clip board to get her scheduled. Now with no sense of urgency to take care of me, the second employee taped up a few items to put on hold for the woman scheduling the appointment.  Neither employee ever looked up at me to say, good morning, we will be right with you, nothing. I was just about to leave my purchase on the counter when she decided to take care of me.

No offer of a free makeover session for me. The last woman was encouraged to bring a friend. What triggers them to only offer to ""certain"" customers. I'm pretty sure I spent more money then the two woman in front of me combined. Was it because I wasn't wearing makeup on this morning, so they assumed I don't wear makeup? Was I not dressed properly because I already worked 8 hours in one of my 3 restaurants? I usually shop on line due to my busy schedule but this morning I decide to go in and get the worst guest experience ever. When my schedule allows I will make the time to return my purchase and spend my hard earned money elsewhere. Maybe a little team development on not to always judge a book by it's cover.

I was there for 6 hours
SIX HOURS!!!
I left with a whole different look. I didnt get the hair cut I wanted. Or the color I wanted and was told that I'm a ""tough case"" because of the color I had on my head previously.
I felt like she did what she wanted. She rinsed my hair in the sink and after rinsing she applied more bleach and toner. My roots ended up almost white. The rest did not. I'm just so upset. I've had my husband dye my hair at home with box bleach and ended up with the colors I wanted in 45 minutes, today I was there six hours with no happy ending.

It was almost like there was a signal jammer in the store. I heard several customers complaining about the same thing. When I asked an employee about it, I was told it was because of the roof on the shopping center blocks cell service, which makes no sense, as my phone works great when I am in the stores on either side - but like I said, my phone worked great in the store until a few months ago. Not to mention, it's literally the same strip center, with the same roof and my phone/internet is fine in every other store in that same shopping center.

No customer service at this store. Not one single staff member would acknowledge me or even bothered greeting me. Brushes on shelf were not stocked and I could not get anyone to assist me or check for inventory or to even see if I could maybe order for pickup another day if something wasn't in stock. The store was not busy and the staff was only interested in talking amongst themselves and another girl ignored me when I asked if she could help and looked annoyed because she was busy texting on her phone. I ended up taking my business to Sephora which is a better quality store that actually has staff that appreciated my business.

I called to ask if they had anyone who specialized in natural African American hairstyling.  My daughter wanted to cut her hair short and style it. I was assured that yes this could be done and an appointment was booked at 6:15 on Friday. We are understanding, so when we received a call asking if the appointment could be pushed back an hour we agreed to it. We arrived early for the new time and the stylist and I both agreed in order to do it right, it wasn't worth starting on it that night as the store closed at 9.

The new appointment was Sunday at 11. We arrive and show the stylist a couple of styles that we would like. We ask for the stylist's expertise on which one was doable and I asked again was she sure before she started cutting my daughter's hair. The stylist chose a style and started cutting.  Two hours into the cutting I step outside for some fresh air. I'm texted to comeback inside because the stylist was done.  To my surprise, no styling was done and the cut didn't seem right for the style she chose.  The reason I was given was that she didn't have the time. I was told to comeback in 5 weeks and that she the stylist, books up fast.

I have a few questions and will be reaching out to the corporate office in Illinois, Mary the CEO, and possibly share our experiences on several social media platforms.

Questions:

Why was our appointment pushed back an hour but there wasn't an attempt to ask the next customer for a little more time ?
Why weren't we told that it may not be finished ahead of time so we could make a decision ?
What happened to all the talk about showing us products that was going to be used on her hair that we could purchase to maintain her hair ?  No product was used and no assistance was offered.
Why during the cutting I was constantly reminded that it would be extra but never given a price or a sense of wanting to perform what was needed ?  I was okay with it all.  Maybe the stylist somehow knew what I could afford ?

I still payed for the service, not knowing if I received the 20% discount promised for first time customers. My daughter was heart broken but didn't want to cause any trouble. Ulta taught my daughter and I a valuable lesson.",2018,FL,Florida,30.4813907,-87.20770759999999,G,9,0

But  I find this particular location the most messy and unsanitary Ulta that I have ever been to. The high end makeup displays have spills all over them, and broken testers. And a lot of the time you are lucky if there is even half of the testers available to swatch. Which makes it very hard to choose a perfect shade of foundation. After spending over a $100 with my bag in hand, I asked politely for a small sample of foundation that I was interested in purchasing on my next visit. But I was rudely told that they don't give out samples at ulta. I can understand that some people just want freebies, but I had the proof in my bag that I was a paying and regular customer (platinum). I have encountered a couple of friendly and helpful employees here, but you get good service very rarely. In fact, I've had some of the worst service of my life at this store. I wish this location would get on the ball. Until they do, I'll do my Ulta shopping online.",2016,FL,Florida,29.6581464,-82.41559319999999,G,8,0

I wanted hair extensions and make-up. Easy enough right? Wrong! Not at this location!! First off there was only one person working the salon I sat there for 20 minutes only to be told the girl isn't there. So I didn't even get any information. Next I went  go and get my Clinique. I stood there for another 20 minutes and no one helped me. I wandered around until I found help and the woman was really sweet but refused to even go to Clinique and was insistent on selling me Torte. It's a great product,  just not what I wanted. Needless to say, I left empty handed. I've scheduled my hair elsewhere and probably be going to Sephora for my make-up.

I have never been approached by an employee to ask if I needed help when shopping on the ""drugstore"" side. Also, the checkout line at this particular store can move slowly.

I cannot think of one time that I've had a pleasant experience at this Ulta. Every single time I am confronted with snobbish glares from employees, rude and not helpful workers, unclean makeup products, and now misinformation. Two weeks ago, I was picking a few things up for a trip I was going on (eyebrow pencil, new highlighter, et cetera) and I was checked out by a woman with red and green hair. The whole time she was ringing in my orders, she was talking to customers at the next register paying NO attention to me. Now I'm not saying ""boohoo pay attention to me"" I'm saying that I had a question that I had to stand there for two minutes after she handed me the receipt to ask. My question was ""when is the next shipment of the Too Faced Sweet Peach palettes coming?"", she then seemed annoyed and told me that the last shipment would be April 16th. This morning I arrived at Ulta an hour before the store opened and waited. Once the doors opened, I excitedly rushed to the Too Faced section of the store and there. Were. No. Palettes. I saw the same red and green haired woman who ""helped"" me two weeks prior were helping other customers so I went to the woman at the cash register who then told me the shipment came on Thursday. Thursday???? Thanks a lot Ulta, I guess I will just have to spend $500 online for a palette I could've bought for $50 in store if you would have just told me the correct date.

They also have a mini MAC store and a fairly extensive list of makeup from all the major names, including IT cosmetics and of course, they have an ""in house"" salon. I wasn't as impressed with the skin care area, but then my favorite products can only be found online at the Dermstore so I'm probably not the right person to review their skincare selection. What impressed me the most was the customer service. I walked in the store and was greeted immediately and when I stopped in front of a display, a team member was right there to see if I needed help. When I wanted to try a shade of the product, she grabbed a clean makeup sponge and proceeded to help me find the right shade. She then stayed with me as  I browsed through the store to make sure I found everything I was looking for.

I've been an Ulta shopper for several years and never had someone offer to help match me on anything. Tonight I was in need of foundation and wanted something different from my normal UD brand. I had been trying to match myself on the Born this Way brand and she came right over offering a suggested color and then took 2 shades and offered me a seat to match me. She was very knowledgeable of my current brand, this brand, and a third i had been considering. I shared with her my skin concerns and she deals with similar issues and was able to give me some tips. She even helped me get a powder (in Pür brand) to use as a setting powder or alone. I was very impressed by all the genuine help and knowledge. When I couldn't find my face wash (FaB) she offered to order it for me and ship it free.
I've always used the BWK GA store for most of my purchases, but after tonight I'll be heading back to Hinesville again and again. I hope somehow she sees this review.

That being said, I hadn't really been back until recently bc I absolutely love the size and option of selection for pretty much every single item. When I did return, I didn't expect it to be anything spectacular, since I already had in mind what I was going inside for. They were fairly busy, with two registers open and occupied checking customers out. However, BOTH employees acknowledged my walking in and took the time to say hello and pleasantries even though they were busy taking care of their other shoppers. This is kind of a big deal to me, being in customer service all of my working life! Good...no.  Fantastic start. I'm extremely fair complected, and sometimes have to battle with dark circles under my eyes as a result. Now, I already struggle finding a foundation to match my pale skin without causing a line, so I almost didn't even bother to look at concealer thinking I'd run into a similar issue. BUT there was a gentleman, obviously very feminine, and also wearing makeup standing pretty close to the door (sorry, I don't remember his name, but he was just fabulous!) I told him my potential dilemma and my budget lol, and before I could tell him my price range he had the perfect, reasonably priced concealer (a shade lighter than my ridiculously ghost colored foundation!)

So, I went into ULTA desperate to find a makeup that would cover some bumps on my face that came out of the middle of nowhere 😲 After being there MAYBE 2 minutes... I was approached by this very helpful lady that was asking if I needed help. So of course I began explaining what was going on as she was carefully inspecting my face, & then.....  she made a LIFE-CHANGING suggestion that has in fact been just that....life changing! She told me to stop using pore minimizing primer (it's what I had in my hand) and to try using a hydrating primer instead....(as she placed the bottle in my hand) Then she walked me straight to a table in the front and suggested that I began using a moisturizer in the morning & at night. She said she believed that ALL THE BUMPS appear to be from my face being overly dry. Guess what, she was 100% right! My face DID start breaking out real bad when we had our 1st few really hot days bc I was sweating profusely. So to say the least... I've been using these 3 items religiously since and my face is completely clear again!!! I recommend everyone that loves make-up/beauty to this place. Yes, they're a little pricy BUT.....you get what you pay for! Cheap make-up aint good, & good make-up aint cheap... Pick which you'd rather have 🤷 I'm sticking with the ""good make-up aint cheap"" and paying that extra buck so I'll be back y'all 😃 👌

When I went to cash out, I received a .24 FL OZ tube of Clinique Moisture Surge FOR FREE!!! It's almost like it was meant to be! ❤ It might be a small amount but this little tube has lasted a very long time! A little goes a VERY long way with 90% of their stuff. But again, cheap is no good, and good isnt cheap! 👌 Sorry for such a long review, I just had to share 😊",2019,GA,Georgia,32.6219291,-83.66826089999999,G,6,1

Therefore it seems that EVERYTIME I enter the store, there is always kids running around nd yelling knocking merchandise off shelves or using it to play with while running in the store nd their mothers just stand there on the other side of the store picking out lip sticks nd eye lashes. Nd when someone makes an obvious gesture about how the yelling nd running is clearly upsetting other shoppers the mothers get an attitude nd bring them to their side but then they start screaming nd crying EXTREMELY loud nd dont do anything about it.

Why do I shop here? Because they sadly have everything I need, and because of my purchases I get some perks - when they are willing to allow me to have them (depending on which rule they have for that day and who’s applying the rule).

Ulta CDA gets one star simply because of selection. You can get drugstore brand make up and department store/high end beauty products in the same store. Huge selection of make-up, bath and body products, and tons of great brands for hair care. This specific store is terrible. The staff are indifferent if not out right rude, and that's if they aren't just ignoring you or sometimes no where to be found. Selling the higher priced beauty and hair products requires some product knowledge and customer service, in fact to an extent a lack of product knowledge can be overlooked when the staff is courteous and willing to help research/find answers to customer questions. If you're paying their prices you want to know what you're buying and not everyone knows exactly what they need. If you know your exact product, color, size etc then you'll probably be fine here but if you need to be product or shade matched good luck. They have one helpful person on staff, the Clinique rep. She is super nice, very helpful, and tries her best with the other products although I recently found that's she's a consultant and not an actual Ulta employee. Which actually makes more sense. I have an Ulta credit card, I shop pretty regularly but only because there is no other option in town. Its painful to spend money at this store because of the staff/employees. My most recent trip was in response to an area specific mailer, a sale for which they had no stock, they had an empty wall where their store makeup line used to be (Ulta Beauty) it was on the first page of a 10+ page mailer, but when I found someone to see if they had the sale items the response was ""yeah I don't know, maybe it's discontinued?"" Sale said ""Brand new products by Ulta Beauty"" they didn't stock for the sale. They had 30+ freebies (with purchase) on advertisement-they had 3.

No hello when we walked through the door. I knew what I wanted just needed a color match to be sure what shade to buy. I asked at the front desk after standing for a few minutes without help. She called someone, meanwhile two employees walked by and said they were helping other customers....and someone else would help me. So I waited and there were maybe 3 other customers in the store...where is the staff?

Updated: I got color matched in less than 30 seconds they gave me my color and I purchased it for around $40. When I got home I realized she had handed me the wrong color and when I went back to exchange at they were completely out of my shade. Even worse they emailed me a receipt which I never received so they told me they could not exchange without a receipt... I explained all of this to the manager. I couldn't even exchange it for the right color because they were out of stock. So frustrating... Will be ordering the products online from now on.",2019,IL,Illinois,41.6647444,-88.4646896,G,11,0

I had went to a reputable salon a week prior to get something done. i was pretty open to anything considering what i was working with.  that reputable salon didnt really want to do much with it and wanted to color it in stages. that sounded pricey so i went to ulta with no hope. but they were willing to do whatever i wanted with the understanding i could potentially damage it further. they did talk with me about what i was thinking and we agreed on a dark purple with shadow root. i wanted different dimensions of purple. i wish i knew the ladies name who did my hair however long story short she did a great job and after 2 washings since leaving the salon my hair is more softer and overall healthier. not only is my hair better but the price though was cheap. i was thinking 150 to 200 for what she did i left with a hundred dollar bill not including the tip. i am so happy with my hair and i I included pictures. you can just look at hair and can tell that its healthy. which is just mind blowing to me. will definitely return and definitely reccomend. will update with the name of the hair dresser.,2020,IL,Illinois,39.7683713,-89.7090164,G,3,1

From the very moment I walked in the store, I was followed by 2 and 3 associates. I had a basket full of probably $300 worth of make up and other items. After about 20 minutes of being stalked like I was about to rob the place I got the 2 items from my basket that I originally wanted to get and left. I had been in this store a few times before and was never treated this way.

I was in the store for over 10 minutes, multiple employees walked past me and didn't ask if I needed any help. I had to ask for help at the front counter.

I don't understand why all the employees don't have Hand held devices to check out customers. The lines to check out are always long and ridiculous.

Ulta keeps wanting to pretend they can sell prestige and luxury products but shopping there is like shopping at TJ Maxx or Walgreens. When cosmetics cost the same at all retailers,  why bother with a lackluster shopping experience when you can be treated like you matter at a department store or just order online.

It is just this location, as Ulta has expanded their customer service has become nonexistent. It is pretty sad because they started off great.",2021,IL,Illinois,39.7683713,-89.7090164,G,4,0

The customer service is excellent, from a first day employee I met, Sadie, a Benefit Specialist of only a few months in town, Alex, to the Retail Manager, Dovie.  ALL of the employees are truly interested in helping meet your beauty, cosmetic, hair care, and skin regimen needs.  Many of them have gone far above and beyond for me.  They have encouraged products that work for me and tried them on me, while discouraging ones that weren't as flattering.  They also truly promote the feeling of beauty from within and expressing oneself while having fun with getting ready.  Thanks to the great customer service, I've tried many new things I probably wouldn't have dared before.  And the compliments I get are amazing!  So much fun!  They also have brought the complacency out of my mother.  She got an amazing brow tint from Alex for the first time and her brows have never looked better, especially with her now going grey, short and spunky with her hairstyle!  She also stepped out of the box, and found a non-feathering lipstick by Too Faced Cosmetics, which has been a concern at her age.  She tried two awesome new colors that she would have never tried, had she not been encouraged to in the store.  Now, I can't find her without them on!  Ulta Beauty in Springfield is the very best.  I try not to go anywhere else!  I'm a Platinum, loyal customer due to Dovie, Jocelyn, Sadie, Brooklyn, Alex, Hope, Madison and many others that are there to bring your inner beauty out!  Great products, Great customer service, Great sales and promotions... What more could you ask for?",2015,IL,Illinois,39.7683713,-89.7090164,G,5,1

There’s no point in legit YELLING at a customer when YOU fail to keep temporary face masks in your facility. You can kindly ask the customers to leave but I think her upbringing was lacking.  Perhaps Rachel never learned to properly greet and politely ask someone to leave. Her tone and attitude are unwelcoming and inappropriate. Please refrain from interacting with her at the cashier. She makes transactions awkward and uncomfortable. In case her name isn’t actually Rachel she has short blond hair and looks like a stuck up brat who hates her life and job. Never coming to this location again however the employee working next to her was a total sweetheart. Beautiful and kind.

I actually needed help finding what I was looking for so I stood at the front door like a deer in headlights for a few minutes and still no one approached me. I decided to venture into the store down numerous aisles and finally found the one I was looking for it. By now I've had a number of Associates walked by me and no one offered to assist me. So I got my phone out and looked up what I was looking for and found that Target had it for cheaper so I went elsewhere. I'll definitely be back to Ulta in Goshen definitely not Warsaw.

However lately every time I visit I have had a negative experience thanks to the employees to the point that I'm just kinda like nah, i would rather not have my evening ruined by rudeness.  My last visit all the employees were gathered around a makeup display that i was waiting to look at,  gossiping like high schoolers (although to be fair they didn't look much older than high schoolers).  No one really acknowledged or acted like  there were customers in the store, it was awkward.

My past few experiences have been marred by cashier rudeness.  I was met with an attitude for asking about a sale sign and having a price double checked.  I've always been very polite because I know being a retail cashier can suck but i don't think it's too much to just be kind in return.

I'll probably start shopping more at the Fort Wayne Ultas if i can,  I shopped there for years before moving and can't remember ever feeling dread when walking into their stores.

Update 7-22: the atmosphere has GREATLY improved at this location since I wrote this review.  There's a lot of different people there now and it seems like a much friendlier polite atmosphere. I've gone back to shopping here more.0",2018,IN,Indiana,41.2790661,-85.8551007,G,7,0

With her work and recommendations I went from box- dyed black with bleached blonde under on only one section (over- processed, damaged, breaking, etc.) To what I have now. She was able to color correct my mistakes over time but in the process she gave me a color and style I could live with. When I went back recently and asked for a red shade she perfectly gave me what I needed for my skin tone and gave me a style that worked for my fine hair, made expert product recommendations that have brought softness and body and life back to my hair.

Every time I go in - and I do mean every - I am lucky if I get asked if I need help and I more often than not have to search for someone. Then, once found, they are quick to scurry away from me. Are they busy you ask. You bet. Talking about their weekends, their boyfriends, their vacations, their surgeries, their hang. overs. No joke. I hear more about their lives than about products. Complete disrespect unless you ooze money walking in the door - then you might attract attention. I don't feel welcome or respected here. That's why I go to Sephora now as often as I can.

Rude and ugly, rather stand around and talk  to each other. Never ever anyone to help you with anything
I have walked around store for an hour and not one person offered help
Went to store to return item, lady Very  obviously did not want to help And was upset that she had to stop hanging out with her coworkers and chitchatting, Refused to let me return my item with the receipt because I bought it 32 days ago because their policy is now 30 days. I have been a diamond elite member for many years and I am full aware of their return policy and that this woman was completely wrong. I called customer service and all they could do was apologize and tell me to go back to the store which I don’t think I’m ever going to go back to that store I’d rather throw away the item and lose the money thing go back and continuously deal with the rude customer service since the day they opened.
Store is always Disorganized and dirty

Please, Ulta beauty teach your employees business professionalism, if they are having a bad day, they shouldn’t take it out on the customers and install cameras in all aisles so people don’t have to be followed around.

I liked that a lot.  I arrived early morning about an hour after opening abs proceeded to wander around.  There was 1 young lady on register checking out customers.  No other employees were on the floor.  I asked for help and she did call the back for someone... which I appreciated.   I wanted to try Juvia foundation.... a brand I never wore before.  Everything and I mean ever is wrapped up so you can’t use or really see a tester.  I get it:  we are still working thru Covid restrictions.  So I asked if she could open and maybe let me see a few.  She said no.  I can do my best to help you and if you don’t like it you can bring it back.  Now... she wasn’t rude and I’m sure she is just stating policy that they have told her to say.   But... who has time to keep running back to ultra because your foundation didn’t match!!!  That’s a waste of time!  I decided if I’m going to do that I may as well order using Amazon  from the comfort of my couch.  Next day shipping and easy returns!

The prices will vary drastically depending on the service you get and what you're having done, so there's not a good way to determine what the end cost is going to be. I always book online with whoever is available, and this is probably not a good idea.

For my latest salon service I wanted my hair bleached and then dyed one solid color. I was quoted $250 by the stylist when I got in the chair, which was a more than I was expecting but I said it was fine. 4 or 5 hours later, I was told that my total would be TWICE that amount, and my jaw almost fell off. I did spend at least an hour sitting and doing nothing in the middle of my service because my stylist (master level iirc) went to cut someone else's hair. So she took an hour's worth of work off my total .... which was great, but my bill still came out to over $400 when I was originally quoted $250. There was also several times I was sitting at the sink when she said she'd be back in a few minutes, and it turned into a half an hour. I spent half the day at the the sink, which was really uncomfortable, especially because the neck pillow kept falling off. At one point the dye got in my eye which was extremely painful, so I had to go to the sink and wash it out with paper towels the best I could. Then when the stylist blow dried my hair, she literally burned my ear! Salon hairdryers are uncomfortably hot, but I've never outright had someone burn me with one before. I was very patient with all of this and still left an appropriate tip of 20%+ for the services. Still, I don't think I'll be using the Ulta salon anymore. (They also tried to get me to schedule to get my roots done a month later for another $120... no thanks. I'll learn how to bleach my own hair.)

I think other customer were looking for help too, because one stopped her to ask questions while she was helping me. I ended up finding the item myself, after she said they didn't have it and when I got to the register, the cashier had stepped away to help someone on the floor.

I followed up with ""what do you recommend we do"" and got no response. I typically really enjoy Ulta, but this is pretty disappointing.  I've been looking for other salons to fix the melting color problem, but would like to request a refund from Ulta.

I was greeted at the door and decided to browse the store to see the new additions before picking up the palette. As I was browsing, I noticed that the shelves were very poorly stocked and the displays were messy and disorganized. Maybe I caught them right before a restock? During my browsing I was never asked if I needed help finding anything. Being put-off by the mess I decided to search for this eyeshadow palette to no avail. After hovering around the immediate area for 10 minutes, I finally found a group of employees standing around chatting and asked if they could check if the palette was in stock. One employee spoke up and asked rudely if I had looked for the palette yet. To which I replied, yes and mentioned that the website shows it as in stock. She didn't skip a beat on informing me that I can't rely on the website and that if I didn't see it then it's obviously not in stock; no offer was even made to double check that I hadn't missed it.

First impressions walking in it was big..  No one greeted me or asked me if i needed help upon entering and i arribed at 10:18 am. I grabbed a bag and started looking around . i got super overwhelmed due to amount of money i had to spend.  But i had a list.   First item on my list was for morphe products and brushes.  I found christina up at the registers she was awsome she walked around helping me. Excellent employee. She tells me there is no morphe brushes or products cause they dont get many in ....super bummed... Not one single morphe product.  After walking around with her .  they were out of almost every single item i wanted ... Toofaced born this way foundation, mac products they only had lil travel size setting sprays and there famous two shades of red lipsticks.  Selection was horrible ...... Angela at the bennifit brow bar was awsome she took over for christina and helped me find products i should get like brow pen ils mascara and blush palettes.  All in all it was a fun experience .  those two employees were great they need a award ya couldnt have asked for better customer service honest to god. But the selction sucked!!!

Never ask if I need help even as I stare at them waiting for another customer that they're helping, they will walk away. The girl I finally got to help me told me they didn't have the product I had bought at another Ulta (which probably means she didn't know where it was) then I settled for another foundation which she told me didn't come with a sponge and then tried to make me buy a brush for (another $42).

I never get asked for my rewards card so they can add my points and sometimes I get randomly followed. I trusted an Ulta in Coon Rapids to do my hair and makeup for my wedding and they were awful and then demanded a tip. You can't even hide my blemishes on my wedding day even though I'm paying you and then the cashier has the nerve to ask for money? No thanks.

The girls at Ulta don't really have good makeup on ever, so I'm not sure if they have any makeup experience period, but I would expect common courtesy as far as customer service goes and it's never the case when I visit.

I walked around for about 10 minutes looking for a specific product and when I could not find it I stopped and asked an employee if they had any tangle teezer hairbrushes she looked at me and says “I am not sure, I am new” she continued to stand there and look confused for about a minute then went and asked another employee who basically ignored her and answered the phone and walked away. She came back to me and said “sorry I am not sure and it is really busy right now” there were maybe 10 to 15 people in the store and 1 person waiting at the register. I never did get my answer or find it. I decided to give them another shot and do a pick up order for a bottle of lotion today and it took 10 minutes after I checked in to have the item brought out to my car which was strange since once again the parking lot was fairly empty.

I'm used to having nail supplies near the makeup, like many other retailers have it. They DID have the weird, hard-to-find item I needed, but I don't think I ever would have been able to find it on my own. But bonus points to the associate that was able to look up on a device, verify it's what I wanted, then go find it in store for me before checking out.
I wish some of their makeup tools had the cheaper ones in ""bulk"" for sale, like cheap foundation wedge sponges, 6 for a buck, kinda thing. There's a lot of makeup DIYs that use those.
However, they had a great variety of makeup cases for almost every storage need from the large ones that are a little over a foot tall, to little ones that you can carry in your purse. If I didn't already have a case, I would have picked up one of theirs!
All in all, it's Ulta. Since I've been visiting their stores more often the past year, their prices are MUCH more competitive than years ago and if I need more than one makeup or moisturizing item, I go there instead of my usual WalMart/Target.",2020,MN,Minnesota,45.181235,-93.2361945,G,2,1

Yesterday I bought a expensive concealer that came  with a free gift. Tried it on and it didn’t work. I returned it only to be told for the first time that I had to return the whole free gift it came with three items. I went home and found majority of everything except for this mini sponge. Thinking since I had the receipt and everything else that they would work with me never happened. They told me that this is their policy and without everything I couldn’t return only exchange for a different color. What is very upsetting  to me coming from someone whose worked retail for two years is that they kept repeating the same thing to me instead trying to come up with a solution because at that point I just wanted to return it and get my money back. Now I would understand if I was told this about their return policy while purchasing the concealer,  or even if it was notated on the receipt then it wouldn’t be a big deal to me but that was never the case. I even would have  been ok with a gift card with the full amount I paid. So FYI if you purchase something and thinking you may end up returning  the item ask  about their return policy when it comes to specific stuff because I would hate for you to end up like me today upset and feeling like nothing was ever resolved and given little to nothing returned back on my card.",2020,MO,Misuri,38.8058421,-90.3087932,G,9,0

An employee should have or at least attempt to obtain knowledge of the products that are sold at this ULTA. I encountered a person with a kind demeanor, but lacking in the area of knowledge, and this hindered the employee's ability to process information, accurately- creating unnecessary confusion and dissatisfaction. I had to endure apathetic tones and dismissive attitudes from other staff members- who this employee sought information from. Needless, to say I walked away displeased and this store will miss out on future sales. For you see- I may not have appeared to be a person that is highly invested in cosmetics on this particular day, it was a Saturday- I was very casual, and  without makeup. I deliberately came to ULTA without makeup, because I was looking for new foundation and other skin care products.  Consequently, the assumption that appeared to be the supporting driver to deliver poor and apathetic service is unfortunate for this location. I spend a lot of money on self-care products and I have friends and family members that do same- whom I will be advising not to attend this location.

There were 3 girls standing behind the checkout counter laughing and talking. I'm all for having fun at work, but dont ignore your customers. I walked the aisles for about 30 mins before anybody asked if I needed help. And when I looked for someone to ask, i couldn't find anybody besides the girl who was cashiering, the mac girl busy with a makeup client, and the girls in the salon. There were no floor walkers! When I went to ulta when they were newly opened, they used to give out samples at checkout for larger purchases and I loved this because 9 times out of 10 I ended up going back and buying a full size of one of the samples. It's a great way to discover new products. However, this time, my total came to $250 and I asked if they had any good samples and the girl said they dont do that anymore. Its very disappointing.

My girlfriend and I got our hair done here since they offered 25% off your first ""service”. Be careful in the meaning of this promotion; they define this as 25% off a portion (the least costly action) of your visit. They break up your appt into specific portions; for example a haircut, a color, and a highlight are individual services so they try to only take 25% off only one of these functions. This is completely misleading. After the discount the total cost was still far more than what anyone should be paying for a cut and color. I've found most of the salons in the entire Las Vegas area are charging prices you'd expect to see on the strip. I may have visited another Ulta salon if the prices were realistic. But this isn't Hollywood and we're not celebrities so expecting people to pay $150-$200+ (one of the stylists charged over $200!!!) for haircuts and colors is absurd...and then to expect tips..just ridiculous, these aren't surgeons. Also, my girlfriend got pink put in her hair and there was quite a price charged for this, but the color was completely gone after only a week and half!! If it wasn't going to hold, that should have been clearly communicated up front.
My stylist was very nice, but I asked for red color with partial highlights and I'm now a blond with no red at all.",2015,NV,Nevada,36.0388067,-114.9927905,G,8,0

To sum it up this is a nice store, some empty holes on the shelves which is understandable I believe they are a high traffic store. I go there every 4-8 weeks to get my hair trimmed (I have a pixie) and always have Gianna do it as she does a great job. The staff are friendly people, usually quite knowledgeable but if they don't know something they do their best to find out for you. I was terribly upset when Ulta as a whole stopped carrying Laura Geller, now they have stopped carrying Kate Somerville. They have really nice sales and nice things on clearance occasionally. I was a little upset when I spent $400 today and didn't get any samples at checkout. Next week I'll be getting my first facial at this Ulta and will report back once done🙂.

[EDIT] The facial with microdermabrasion was definitely worth the money, I noticed my skin brighter and generally more glowy than it has ever looked right away. I'll be going back in 5 weeks for just the microdermabrasion and in ten weeks for the facial+MDB. I'm very happy with my results.

I've been a huge Ulta fan for three years now, ever since I had a mid-life crisis, changed careers, became an esthetician, and started buying every single beauty product I own at Ulta. I've recently started coming to this mall and just this past weekend decided to check this Ulta out with my teenaged sister. I was immediately put off at how it wasn't that busy in there, yet not one person said ""hello"" or offered to help me. One of them looked right at me and passed me numerous times, and nothing. It astounded me because I felt it was obvious that I didn't know where anything was. Maybe it was because I had my toddler with me? She just pretended she was dusting the store and not to mention that her make-up application was downright scary. I hate to sound this way, but she looked like a tacky vampire, in an attempt to showcase as many products as possible on her face, i guess? When did such an unrealistic look become a thing? I guess I sound naive when I put it that way. Anyway, I didn't rate a 2 because the Benefit girl helped me out, and then this other girl was super nice to my child, and wound up being my cashier- she saved the whole situation.

This can be a huge savings when purchasing a cosmetics or blow dryers or straight iron.
This store is one of my favorite locations. Everything is neat and clean. The same associates are extremely helpful. Best in mind, you cannot get samples here like Sephora's. Clinique is the only beans that will offer you a sample. When checking out, make sure to ask if any of your purchases cubes with a bonus sample. Sometimes they do and the associates forget because it's so busy.
Twice a year, the have huge sales on the prestigious cosmetics. Huge savings for that month. Look carefully because each day during that month, they have different offerings.

Looked at me like I was dumb for not finding it... checkout was another nightmare as as patient as i was trying to be there was an older associate ringing who did not know what she was doing and should be trained more. She forgot to give the change to the guest in front of me. Called over the same manager who handed me the palette while yelling at me someone would be with me in a moment. It took me 15 mins to get rung out with only one person in front of me being helped. just got home and went to open it and this is what it looked like! What?!?! This is not even usable and when I called customer service she was very sassy with me stating that I “should not do anything crazy tonight”  and literally chuckled at me and told me I can take my time to address this situation. For the rudeness across the store from not only associates but managers and customer service I am appalled at this.

My most recent trip on Thursday May 9th 2019, I found a new color I hadn't previously tried of the Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade which I wanted to purchase after swatching the tester. There weren't any left in to purchase,  so I asked a manager if they perhaps had more stock somewhere they could grab for me. The manager had another employee check their stock drawer, however there were none left in stock. The employee suggested that I may have them order it for me and have it shipped to my home for free,  all for the same price I'd pay on store. After about 5 minutes of the manager attempting to order this item for me we realized it wasn't going through because I was using a debit card not a credit card (not sure why the register and website both take debit cards but this process didn't) so I was unable to have it ordered. However,  the manager gave me a card that gives a code to be used when ordering online that gives free shipping so that I could still get it ordered and delivered for store price. Like most other stores, they could have just told me it was out if stock and called it a day. However, they went out of their way to be friendly and very helpful which was appreciated. A man was also very friendly and helpful when assisting me with trying to find aftershave for my boyfriend. Overall, the staff is very outgoing and helpful, but not pushy or overbearing whatsoever.

Quite a few times I went in for specific items on sale and turns out they weren't actually on sale like they stated. When you ask for something specific, you are generally walked to the newest, latest and 'greatest' products that they are trying to push while they convince you it's what you need when it really isn't. I went in with a friend who needed something for the puff under their eyes, they showed them everything BUT what they asked for..... EVERY single thing you're looking for? You're taken over to the brand new way overpriced items. Their associates need more training,  specifically on their people skills. You could literally walk around for 20 minutes not knowing where something is and I can't even tell you how many employees will walk right by you and not say a word. I've only met two helpful people at this location and I've gone a few times. The problem now is, if you DO ask for help... again, you're taken over to the brand new items that you likely can't afford seeing as how you CAME IN BECAUSE THINGS WERE ON SALE ...I'd rather order online and hope it turns out good vs go into this store. It's the closest Ulta to me and that makes me sad. It's really the younger employees that are the problem. They act like special snowflakes, especially when you don't want the product they directed you towards. ESPECIALLY when it comes to price, you get the snobbiest looks which doesn't make a potential customer feel all that great. Good thing about this joint?

As they went on fighting with each other if it was a wig if it wasnt laughing.

They wax style and teach u how to fill and style ur brows. It was about $21 but was worth every penny. Aside from the styling /waxing/ coloring in.

I even braught a sample of the color i wanted and my hair was already lifted. They diden't even want to give me a discount at first for the botched job. Wanted to charge me $229 , ended up having to pay $175 for a horrible dye job I am now stuck with. They blamed it on not being toned enough and that they could simply fix it with toner..clearly they have no clue how to dye hair.  Toner was not the issue, its the dye they used , the way it was dyed and the length of time the dye was on my hair that resulted in permanant grey color. I feel like i should have never gotten charged for this. What a rip off, the workers seemed like they knew what they are doing at first , but I should have known better..never again going back to this store.

And my daughter has ALLOT of hair so it was no easy kid cut! It was my daughters first real haircut aside from getting it  trimmed so my daughter was a little nervous but Chelsea quickly made her very comfortable! She listened to what we were looking to achieve and was so pleasant and helpful and adviced us on how to keep the length but give her hair more of a style. And she nailed it! She is a very talented stylist! I will definitely be going back to her! And my 5 year old daughter wants her hair cut by Chelsea as well. It was so nice to see my daughter so excited after the haircut! She was immediately making videos and taking selfies! I can't thank Chelsea enough! 💜 I would definitely recommend Chelsea!,2019,NY,New York,40.7765905,-73.03610669999999,G,4,1

Men have grooming needs as well and Ulta is the one stop shop for name brands at a reasonable price and convenient location. Not only that if you use the Ulta Rewards Card you earn points for money off future purchases as well.
I highly recommend shopping here in the store or online with Ulta they have all the same name brands you find in department stores as well as the name brands you find in stores such as Walmart.

She knew she screwed up I could tell by the look on her face after she took the towel off my  head and while we were both looking in the mirror.

The store is beautiful and although I'm sure their job requires them to ""ask if I need help"" while watching for theft in this area. It really killed my experience, I wasnt able to walk 5 aisles before being cornered by 4 different people all in ears reach of the other, I just wanted to shop in ease. Everyone seemed very friendly and helpful but I just felt bombarded and unable to enjoy the 5 mins I did of browsing. I bought what I needed but intended on going over to the Mac section for liner, lipstick and blush but honestly just felt uncomfortable. This is not intended to get anyone in trouble they are doing their job but also it would be great if after the first no to needing help the people right there wouldn't ask the same question less than a minute later. I look forwards to going back again soon. It is great to know they are willing to help when needed but I don't like feeling surrounded especially when my purse has a front closure. There was nothing to be suspicious of, maybe they are trying hard because it's new but less is more. I just wanted to think, discover and enjoy.",2019,NY,New York,40.8030985,-72.8595687,G,11,0

I originally came in looking for the ordinary serums but they didn’t have a wide selection like they have online so he was able to help me pick out some alternate products for my skin type and was knowledgeable about a promotion that was going on for the brand that we picked. Awesome customer service. Will definitely  be back to this location.,2021,NY,New York,40.7836924,-73.831816,G,3,1

I always have a great experience at this location. But today I had a cashier named Fabiola be very prejudice and bias towards me. I had two returns, both with receipts, one order consist of nail polishes and the other was a hair serum. She asked me if I used the polishes and I said no I just ordered online because they didn’t have the promotion gift in store and she literally checked my nails to see if the polish I was wearing was the same and when I dipped my card she questioned me multiple times was it the same card on the receipt-which it was. Then we moved on to the second return which was a serum with an email receipt. She refuses to scan the code and has me read it to her and then says Im over the return period I can not return so I say ok and proceed to put the item back in my bag. She then says to me “Oh were you meaning to buy that?” Um excuse me? The same item I just showed you the receipt for and you asked me what day I purchased and all the info that was on the receipt you just looked at. I work in Sephora so im very aware that they train employees to be prejudice against blacks and other groups and people who come in in groups and with families but she needs a write up or something for that very non sensible prejudice and bias behavior. I decided to take the better route then schooling her for treating me in such manner. But please check your employees, train them better or fire them because the next person might not be so nice and it seems this is something she does since she was so comfortable in providing that style of service and that is also a reflection of the company and horrible training.",2021,NY,New York,40.7836924,-73.831816,G,3,0

I go to the brow area, which (by the way when I made the appointment I was given no instruction on where to go) and asked an employee named Monique for help since I have an eye appointment. She rudely asks me ""we'll, did you book an appointment, or?"" and stares at me like I have 8 heads. So at this point I'm just ready to leave, but give her the benefit of the doubt. I tell her ""yes I made an appointment "". She stares like I'm bothering her, so I tell her it's with a woman named Charizma. So she looks over and sees she is finishing up with a client. She tells me she'll be right with me. So I browse around near the brow bar so they can let me know when its my turn. I find some product for purchase and I look at the time. It's around 2:38 and I look over and there's a different client in the chair. So I see Monique and ask her what's going on with my appointment. I let her know I noticed a different person in the seat and wondered what was going on and why I wasn't informed it was my turn. She again rudely asks if I booked the appointment and I just tell her ""yes"". I'm now getting frustrated because she already knew that I booked the appointment so what was the reason behind asking again if I already said yes. She goes and gets the book to ""verify"" I booked the appointment. She sees that I did and says that it's been double booked like I was the one making appointments. She pauses and said I could either wait ANOTHER 20mins or re-book for another time. In conclusion I left extremely dissatisfied and upset. I didn't even purchase my products I picked out and told Monique I won't be back unfortunately. I'm writing this in hopes to make the customer service experience at this location a little more pleasant for customers like me. The lack of communication between employees and customer interaction is missing the mark in my opinion. I could go down the list of the things that could have been done differently to make my experience better but also, one employee lost a client for the day.",2019,NC,North Carolina,35.1713505,-79.42124539999999,G,1,0

How was it 20$ if I had a 125$ reward and only spend 120 today?
Well because she doesn't know how to do her job, after calling customer service I found out that the answer to my original question was yes.
Yes you have to spend 125$ or more to redeem 2000 points, which meant that I just lost 20 of points and paid 20$ extra on top of that.

What a joke, everybody who works at the register should know basic policy.
People spend 2,000$ just to get 2000 points the least you could do is not waist our money !

THEY GAVE ME A FULL SIZE ITEM WHEN I ONLY PAID FOR A TRIAL SIZE ITEM. Worst part... I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THE ITEM BUT THE CASHIER TOLD ME THERE WASN'T A WAY TO CANCEL IT. SHE MADE ME PICK UP THE ITEM WITH MY OTHER PICK UP ITEMS JUST TO LATER BE TOLD BY A NICE MANGER AT THE STORE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN CANCELED FROM THE PICK UP ORDER. SO I GO TO RETURN IT ON 10/13/2020... A DIFF. DAY FROM THE ORIGINAL PICK UP DAY SINCE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PROCESS THE SAME DAY RETURN... & THE CASHIER ONLY FINDS THE TRIAL SIZE ITEM TO RETURN BUT WHOEVER PICKED AND BAGGED THE ORDER, PUT THE FULL SIZE ITEM IN THE BAG. NOW I HAVE TO WAIT FOR A MANAGER WHO IS TAKING FOREVER TRYING TO LOOK UP ANOTHER CUSTOMERS ORDER. I AM RETURNING AN ITEM I WON'T USE... JUST TO FIND OUT I GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL ON IT & SHOULD JUST KEEP IT BUT I ALREADY DROVE TO THE STORE ON MY DSY OFF. NOW WHILE I'M WAITING ON THE MANAGER TO FINISH WITH HER CUSTOMER UP FRONT, I WENT TO LOOK AT THE CHI LAVE CURL SHOT.. CURLING IRON. A $129 CURLING IRON! I DON'T SEE IT ON DISPLAY WITH THE OTHER IRONS SO I ASKED THE OTHER MANAGER THAT WAS OUT ON FLOOR. (MEDIUM/LONG DARK BLACK HAIR MANAGER). I BELIEVE THE NICER MANAGER THAT WAS UP FRONT WAS A BRUNETTE.. ANYWAYS, SHE SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE IT OUT AND SHE HELPS ME OPEN THE BOX SO I CAN LOOK AT IT. AGAIN.. THIS IS A $129 CURLING IRON! NOT CHEAP! THE MANAGER OPENS THE BOX, SETS IT ON THE TABLE AND *HOLDS ON TO THE BOX.. THE ENTIRE TIME I'M LOOKING AT IT AND TRYING TO TAKE IT OUT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I TOLD THIS RUDE LADY ""OK, THANK YOU"" . MEANING YOU HELPED AND NOW YOU WALK AWAY...

And this is not the 1st time I have felt like a thief shopping here. Asking a customer if they're still doin ok  while they shop is fine but if there are several other customers in the store and you ask one customer 3-4 times if they need help, it begins to feel like your overly focused on that 1 customer.

I asked her how the event worked, if we just sit and watch Tarte makeup artists do a models makeup to learn new tips and tricks and she said yes. I wanted to make sure that by signing up to come to the event that didn't mean that I would be getting a makeover. She said no by signing up that didn't mean that I would be getting my makeup done. So the day came, I walked in, and sure enough, by signing up it meant I would be getting my makeup done. Here I am with a full face of makeup because I thought we were going to be watching Tarte makeup artists do a models makeup...not mine. & the icing on the cake, the ""Tarte makeup artists"" were just Ulta employees. So I ended up having an employee do some eye makeup on me, which was pretty at first but once she added the winged eyeliner, it looked pretty bad.

There was two sale signs, one for 50% off, and one for buy two get one free. We were both confused so we asked a employee. She looked at both the signs & also didn't know herself. Then finally found out... the 50% off sale ended two days prior. The employee just walked away, LEAVING THE EXPIRED SIGN UP! Not thinking much of it, I finished my shopping. Went to the Yes To face care line. Face wipes were 50% off, so I grabbed a pack. So we moved on to the Not Your Mother's hair line. There was HUGE sign proclaiming 50% off of their products. THEN even listed out each product under the 50% off sign. So I grabbed what I needed & headed to the register. Not paying any attention (my fault) the cashier rings up my items & I pay. My roommate is now checking out & notices that the Not Your Mothers line is ringing up incorrectly. She politely says that the Not Your Mothers line is supposed to be 50% off per sale sign. She cashier has a blank look on her face and shrugs her shoulders. My roommate took her to the sign where it was in HUGE BOLD LETTERS 50% off & even listing out the products. The cashier simply said... ""Oh that's just listing the products that they make,  the only one that is on sale is the original dry shampoo."" VERY MISLEADING!!!! It didn't say that ANYWHERE! The cashier did not apologize for the misleading sign or anything. She seemed very annoyed she even had to go back there and look. So back to the register to ring up the rest of the items. Big Sexy Hair had a powder play that was originally 17.99 but was on sale for 10.99 (RIGHT UNDER THE PRODUCT WAS THE SIGN FOR THE SALE.) What do you know... it rang up as 17.99!!. At that point my roommate was fed up and didn't want anything! The cashier said NOTHING - and just took it all off the order. No apologies, no honoring the CORRECT ADVERTISED price, just a blank face.   THEN - I had her refund my Not Your Mothers products (because they apparently weren't on sale EVEN THOUGH the sign said they were) & mentioned to her about the  Yes To face wipes. At this point the manager was up front with the cashier. I explained that the Yes To wipes were supposed to be 50% off. The manager rudely said "" Is the sale supposed to be for this size?!"" I Said, i'm not sure it just said wipes?! She did not even respond & grabbed their newspaper to look up if it was on sale. At that point I said forget it, Take it all off I don't want it! Then she said (non-apologetic) ""well i can fix the face wipes the sale started today"". I explained how upset I was to the cashier with the store & how absolutely NOTHING was marked correctly and she shrugged her shoulders again and said ""I mean, there is nothing I can do about it"" UM...HOW ABOUT MARK THE PRODUCTS CORRECTLY & KNOW THE ONGOING SALES YOU HAVE SO YOU DON'T WASTE PEOPLES TIME! So we left the store & looked online at the website & no surprise the Big Sexy Hair powder play was marked on sale for 10.99 - just like we mentioned the sign said but didn't ring up correctly. We were not the only customers having this issue. While we were checking out - I over heard the customer to my right explaining to her cashier that the price of the product was incorrect. I can imagine this happens ALL DAY because no one seemed to know anything about the prices/sales going on.

So recap - This is the WORST store I have ever been in. I will not be surprised if this store goes out of business soon because of the rude employees, management & bad marketing.",2018,OH,Ohio,40.8615261,-81.4294292,G,4,0

The CHI products are significantly less at other retailers that carry similar product lines, who are located either within the same shopping center or directly next door.

The customer service was unacceptable with the lack of product knowledge, to say the least. They would not price match or honor the online coupon of $10 off. They would only offer $3.50 off.

After the miserable experience at the store, I decided to try to purchase this product online to avoid returning to the store. Again, I was extremely disappointed to learn only one gift card can be used per transaction. I am trying to purchase a costly item with three gift cards plus my credit card and multiple gift cards cannot be used for a single transaction.

My frustration has only deepened with the negative interaction with Customer Service via the 866 number and their unwillingness to rectify the situation.

I don't think this company wants anyone's Christmas business. As I'm typing this, the $10 off online coupon has changed to $15 off, but I cannot use it because I have three gift cards!

I struggle with makeup, and it dosent help that i have oily skin plus large pores. I had gone in once before and liked there stuff but was a little worried about price. Went in a few weeks later ( with some extra cash) and ended up getting almost 200 dollers worth of stuff. I was only going to get like 2 things till i found out that you can return for any reason. A big reason why i had never got into makeup is that i have VERY pale skin ( to put into terms, i had to get my foundation in the tone snow lol) and its hard to find items that work well with that. After finding out there return policy tho i said y not?? My only downside ( and why i dident give 5 stars) is that i had to track someone down to get suggestions on makeup, they kinda avoided me. I found out later the girl who was working that area thought i had already been helped, she then showed me multiple items i could use and also did a color match for me. Which was nice because she accutly works for a diff brand then i was looking at ( i try to do crulty free brands) so all in all great place and i will be back :)

I needed one of the make-up artists help on what I should get to contour (I’m just now learning to contour) I got help from seriously THE BEST! Her name is Bridgett Stewart. I’ve never had a make-up artist actually help me so much. She didn’t just try to sell me anything and everything, she actually cared about showing me what products I actually need, that will actually work for my skin tone and teaching me what I needed as far as products to help me learn to contour, but not just that, I was using the wrong color foundation (I was using a powder because nobody in the past could help me with finding a light weight liquid foundation that actually looks good!) Bridgett took her time, actually CARED about what I needed and took her time to teach me how to do my make-up! I’ve never had that experience before. I did end up getting a lot of products, but I was so excited for my new products and brushes! Because I trusted her and everything she said I needed. By the end she had done my full face, and I like a more natural look, and I looked beautiful!!!!!!!!!!! And now at home, with all my new products and brushes, I’m practicing and learning how to do my makeup like Bridgett did for me! The past few times I’ve been to Ulta I’ve left with extremely pricey foundations, that are sitting on my vanity because they don’t work for my skin tone.  (the stuff I got at Ulta from Bridgett, I use all of them!!!!) I just want to say how appreciative I am for Bridgett and the time she took to answer ALL my questions and being so patient since I am such a rookie at doing my make-up! She also does weddings, proms, special events, ect. I have a photo shoot coming up and I’ll be calling Bridgett to do my makeup for it!",2019,OK,Oklahoma,36.2904072,-95.8434629,G,10,1

I rather to drive to Ulta Tulsa (the location next to Nordstrom Rack to be exact), the staffs there are always above and beyond. I never have to ask but they asked me instead about if I want any sample today. or they just gave me a lot of mini gift every time I checked out, even with small purchases sometimes.

After booking my appointment and calling to confirm time and services I show up at scheduled appointment time. A rude girl at the counter sits me in a chair and tells me my stylist will be right with me. Thirty-three minutes later I am finally spoken to by my stylist (no introductions made, I still don't know her name) and directed to sit in a salon chair and explain what I want done. After showing her and watching her facial expressions in the mirror it is clear that something is wrong. She stammers that she just doesn't have the time alotted to do my hair. Even though from the time I confirmed to the time I show her...NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Except of course that I'm at this point FORTY minutes into my slotted appointment time and she hasn't touched my hair. She tells me she can do a cut and put some color on my hair (UH HUH sure that sounds appealing) but she went longer and has another appointment and just doesn't have time for my scheduled appointment. I have a graduation to attend and wanted my hair to look nice.

If you go in looking good say have your makeup on and your hair done it seems they cater to you more verses when you go in in your pajamas and no face makeup on they kind of ignore you and kind of watch you like you're going to steal something. Especially when you're around the samples.  It's kind of odd where is you would think. They'd see an opportunity like oh she has a clean canvas to do demonstrations on or recommendations versus I love your eyeshadow thats already applied. I don't know it's just weird any other Ulta or Sephora I've ever been in they tend to kind of cater towards the people that don't have any makeup on or look lost. so that way they can make more sales and recommendations. I know a few girls who have left there because nobody really helped  them yeah they greeted them and thats about it. But to me personal Beauty and cosmetics is a passion and I'd want every woman to feel as beautiful as they possibly can, not just make that sell but to justify and help somebodys self-esteem and educate them on some of the products.

I just had to add to this review. I’m 50 and decided to try Botox for the first time. Unfortunately I hated the results, in my forehead-In my opinion, my eyebrows got lifted to an odd looking place as a result. I feel like I resemble a soap opera villain, lol. Danielle -who is so talented- helped me get through this embarrassment by reshaping my eyebrows just enough to make it look less cartoonish!! I’m so grateful and so luckily!! My vanity and insecurities are now back in check. It’s nice to have someone who goes above and beyond for me. She also has great advice and helps me pick out products that work so well for me.

My first issue was over a year ago, I had purchased a silicone eyeshadow applicator which never made it into my bag. Instead of just believing me they said they needed to look at the video footage of the day that I purchased the eyeshadow applicator.  I never did hear back about the lost eyeshadow applicator and I never did get my money back or the eyeshadow applicator.  In March 2021 I got a haircut and my brows shaped.  My haircut looked really cute after it was styled.  Once I got home and washed it the next day I realized it was a hot mess.  The front on the left side was 2 inches longer than the right side.  This was not part of the intended style.  My eyebrows were done to perfection.  On the plus side I have found an ULTA cream eyeshadow that I really like.  I have since lopped off the extra 2"" on the left side to make it even with the right side.  I'm sure they have good stylists and maybe it was just not a good day for mine, but I won't be going back to find out if it was a fluke.",2021,OR,Oregón,45.3842479,-122.7506722,G,5,0

When someone finally did help me, they appeared to be in a big hurry to find one shade in one product line and send me off with samples as quickly as possible.

When I wanted some more samples to try at home (because clearly I wasn't going to get much help trying things on in the store), I was told there is a 3-item limit on samples.

I enjoy this store for many reasons and have been shopping at one particular location for years that they all know me there! I have enjoyed other locations, but the one I frequent is closest to me.

So, I have told you that the associates know me; but alone with their friendly disposition, they are knowledgeable professionals, they are well-trained, the products range from drug store affordable to high-end prestige, so it's something for every budget. Also, as a regular customer I enjoy soooooo many great perks, but the average random customer can enjoy great free gifts, opportunity to test & try products in-store, and so much more!! They also have a brow center, beauty salon, and even a facial salon. You must come see for yourself!

I have frequented this store because it is conveniently located close to my home, but with every visit, my experience has deteriorated.

One time I gave in and let the associate recommend something to me which I decided to try, and she told me it was $12. I got to the counter, and it rang up for $24! Not to mention my experience at the brow bar. I am fair hair and skinned and I was looking to darken my eyebrows to a medium brown. The girl slathered my face with petroleum jelly (which broke me out for a week after, and I do NOT break out usually), and then she dyed my brows about four shades darker than what I asked. I wanted a medium brown, and I left with black brows, Vaseline all over my face, and dye smeared all over my forehead and eyelids. I wanted to cry.

This Ulta carries MAC as well as some of the newer brands, which is great if you're interested in trying something new. The prices are reasonable depending on what you're looking for. Personally, I love the fact that they have a well stocked ""drug store section"" where you can purchase cosmetics for a reasonable price. As well as a high end section where you can purchase items that you're willing to spend a little more on. Not only has this Ulta been well stocked, it's clean. And if you've ever seen a cosmetics store.. you Know how messy they can get. People go crazy trying things out, which is great, that's exactly what it's there for. But some people are just careless and make a mess. Which is unfortunate. But the staff at this Ulta does a really great job at keeping up with everything. BTW, if you're looking for a stylists, ask for Jacklyn. I've been to a few places since moving here 5 years ago, and she's one of the best. I'm also a former stylist.

I asked again for help before she walked off and I was sort of more direct this time in asking what type of fragrance I was looking for. She told me what was popular, nothing really about a specific product, and she started to walk off again. I then called out again before she left to ask about where the hair products were. She walked me over to them and then left. I felt really out of place already since this store is mainly geared towards female products, but this made it even worse. I came to this store hoping to get expert help and advice on my questions but I guess you don't get that here as a guy. In the time I was there searching Google for my questions because I didn't get any help, I saw multiple associates helping other customers who happened to be female, but actually helping them, staying with them, and talking about the products.

The last time I came in I was looking for an SPF additive for my foundation/moisturizer. I remembered seeing it at the Ulta on Hulen, but went to this location because it's closer to my home. I saw two employees who were speaking to each other about the sales floor. I apologized for interrupting their conversation and asked if they could help me find the product. One of them rolled their eyes at me and said they didn't think they carried any sort of item that I mentioned. They tried to continue their conversation without letting me respond and asked if they were sure because I saw it at a different Ulta, unfortunately I just didn't know the brand. They said they had no idea. No suggestions, no asking other colleagues, nothing.

Now, I understand not having the item that mentioned, but the person who rolled their eyes was uncalled for. I ended up leaving and going to the Hulen location. The employees there were super helpful and I found my product from their Ulta! It is the ""CoverFX SPF 30 booster drops.""

I never had a need to step foot in this store. Then I did one day and fell in love with the place. Each time I purchased products I would receive samples of other products to try. I tried everyone of them and if I liked it I went back and bought it. It was great! Nowadays you can’t get any samples even if you ask nicely for them. It’s like they are so selfish with samples. So I don’t try new products and in return don’t buy them either. Yesterday this place was out of everything. It’s like the day after Christmas event where they had a massive sell and sold out of everything. That’s how empty their shelves were yesterday. Did you fire your purchasing manager or what??

This last try go-around, I was using The Ordinary brand which left me with embarrassing bumps and lesions on my face. It was humiliating to even show my face, and I didn’t even want to try anything new because I was so fed up.
Adrian helped me out at this location with such a beautiful and helpful personality. He didn’t try to pass judgment on my issue, but instead was extremely understanding. He sold me products based on his personal experience and knowledge with them rather than trying to sell me the most expensive products. I really appreciated how educated he was, and the fact that he didn’t BS me in anyway - just told me the truth.
I haven’t had the chance to try these products yet to see how well they work for me, but even after this one interaction, I can trust to go back to this Ulta to see Adrian for any more issues I might have! I found his demeanor to be incredibly comforting.
Adrian, I might end up owing you my first born child thanks to your help with a lifelong problem! Leave my will to you. Get your name tattooed. Lmfao!

If you return the item at a later date, even if you have your receipt, they will not give you cash back on your DEBIT CARD purchase.  Instead they will credit that money back to your card AFTER THREE BUSINESS DAYS.

So when it's their turn to get money they take it before you can walk out the door with your purchase.  When it's your turn to have your money returned to you, you have to give them back your purchase then wait until they are good and ready to give your money back to you.

#1. They have EVERYTHING beauty there! Seriously! Lots to choose from! I specifically go for my Clinique stuff cuz they're a legit distributor. I expect to full strength products when I pay extra for the brand name mech.! I've heard of fakes out there just recently and I won't do that! Too much to ask? Oh nay, nay! Ulta delivers that!
#2. They carry Clinique! Especially if you can't wait the time you'll wait for the website to get it shipped to you and it arrives.
#3. I love the perfumes there! Quality brand perfumes with a massive selection. Also, scattered bowls of coffee beans to ""cleanse  your senses from so many scents! 2x 👍!
#4. Several locations in my area. Makes it more convenient. Especially in an emergency! And the app seems pretty good so far. I just started that.
I don't like how steep the prices are for SOOO much of the stuff! They've  always had several if not alot of customers in the store I usually go to so business has been pretty good it seems. And really, everything has gone up in price recently across the world! Sign of the times I guess.

When I got there I was told they couldn't do it because they didn't have the rods. I asked the girl which color of rods they did have. She said very few but they didn't have enough to do my hair because it was thick.
I asked her if she could just cut it then. she said she could and proceeded to do so. At the end of the cut I was covered with hair she had not cut it right and when I got home it was definitely the worst cut I had ever received. It was uneven she never even offered to wash it I had asked her to wash the clippings out after she was finished cutting. That never happened.  Then she charged me $30 for the haircut and I had to stand in line for nearly 10 minutes to pay that ""at the front of the store. You'll find it.""  I asked her if there was any kind of discount because you couldn't really do what I had wanted to have done and then she said that no they didn't do that.

I was SO happy when I discovered this store!!! It's beautiful inside, clean, great customer service. I felt their prices were fair on many products especially when so many are difficult to find elsewhere. Of course some you can find cheaper elsewhere, but this store carries products difficult to find. So they're TOTALLY worth it! Oh & they'll teach you how to do your makeup, you do have to book an appt & pay for it. I suggest googling prices, contrary to popular belief, they are NOT free makeovers, they DO charge & prices vary.
They have many sample products, makeup, skin care, perfumes, colognes, nail products, all natural products, etc. I give this store 5* they're totally worth it! If you're into beauty, this is definitely the store for you! ❤️",2019,UT,Utah,41.7510684,-111.832389,G,12,1

I’ve had people slap foundation on over your own makeup at this location!  Also, I’ve had K do a great job on my brows at the brow bar. Then I had M do it. She kind of butchered my brows.

While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier, one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was, ""What's your phone number?""  Really?  No ""hello"", have you found everything you were looking for?""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG, totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.  

I most likely will continue shopping there, but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!!",2017,AZ,Arizona,39.9871886,-75.4032012,Y,9,0

I needed a quick appt for a work thing, after calling around to a few salons Ulta was the only salon that I could find that was open on Sunday & could schedule me with less than 24 hour notice.

Jess was awesome, she did my hair exactly like I asked & didn't try to talk me out of anything (every stylist I go to try to talk me out of the cut that I want, and I've had the same haircut for 15+ years). I brought in pictures to show how I wanted my bangs & she cut them exactly the way the picture look.

What I mean by the latter is that while there are a lot of options for almost any beauty need, there was some bare shelf space where popular items had gone out of stock, particularly in hair care. I could have just caught them before they restocked, but that was my experience. Couldn't get things I went there to buy. 

I read all the unfortunate low-star reviews about the associates before my visit, but visited with an open mind. I was greeted when I went in (one of 2 customers that night). When I had questions, though, I had to go to the registers to ask, because no one was on the floor. Up front, the two associates were talking with one other customer...for a while. Annoying that they felt it appropriate that they both tend to her, and make me wait (I was pressed for time to get to another store before it closed). After a few minutes, one assoc took the customer off down an aisle, and the other remained. She did not approach me after watching me linger for a question all that time, which is not very professional. She was, however, more professional when I approached / spoke to her. 

I asked about availability of any Chanel and Lancôme products, which she said she hopes to be stocking soon. This was great news for locals like me, who don't want to trek to the mall. She said she has tons of customers requesting the two brands, and they should have both in a couple months. She said their Exton store has them, and it's just a matter of time before they do as well. I will check back, and hope to see them in stock soon!

Aside:
When I go to Lancôme at Nordstrom / Neimans (KoP), or call Lancôme's toll free number (800-526-2663), they pronounce it ""Lawn-comb"" but at Ulta, after I pronounced it that way, the associate made a point of saying ""Lan-come"" (like the a in ""land""), like I was in error. Just annoying when someone ""corrects"" me with their own mispronunciation. I don't really care how you pronounce it, but if you're going to ""toe-may-toe / toe-mah-toe"" me, I'll ""toe-may-toe / toe-mah-toe"" you back.",2018,AZ,Arizona,39.9871886,-75.4032012,Y,1,0

I have a credit card with Ulta and I'm also a frequent shopper so it's pretty frustrating and offensive to be treated this way.

Liking what I have discovered so far. This location is super easy to get to since its right across from one of the main Metropolis parking lots.

Pros:
- Tons of selection at all price points
- Lots of coupons and a rewards program, I got a free tube of CK mascara for my birthday!
- Friendly staff whenever I have been here
- Salon with fair prices, haven't tried it yet but I hope to in the future. 

Cons:
- Tons of selection, it can be really overwhelming and staff to provide guidance tends to be minimal.
- Certain brands/styles can be really picked over and sometimes only a few colors are in stock for some brands and types.
- Color samples are hit or miss and can be really old and beat up looking sometimes, but i suppose this happens with destructive shoppers. Even non-sample products can be beat up, be sure to inspect before buying.",2014,AZ,Arizona,39.71344115,-86.35794724,Y,4,1

I wasn't even aware Ulta did facials until I checked out their beauty services online. Right now I am dealing with a few little breakouts that I'm trying to get under control, and found their facial to be fairly inexpensive at less than $50.

Ulta isn't a spa, so I didn't really know what to expect. I figured I would still gave it a chance because they offer 15% off for first-time skin and hair services customers. 

In the end, I would say that I was pleased with the results. Parise did my facial and she made me feel comfortable about everything she was doing. She explained what the products were and what they were for and also paid attention to the areas where I was having issues. The facial also did not involve extraction, which is a plus! Even without the extraction, I still felt like my pores were opened and cleansed. I think the only critical thing I can say is the area in the back of the store is not all that quiet, because there is no door and the salon is back there. So there is a bit of chatter in the back that took me out of the experience a few times. That said, it wasn't too loud, and at least there is a room you can be in to relax as you get your treatment.

I had my facial yesterday and I wanted to wait until today to give a review to see if the products she applied helped. They actually did! The breakout area on my face is reduced as of this morning.

Jaclyn gave me her advice and opinion based on the shape of my face and did a wonderful job cutting it with the layering style I like.

A little later, I went back. I wanted to chop it again, this time to the length of my chin. Coming in riddled with anxieties, Jaclyn helped calm me and decide the logistics of the cut. She even remembered me! Similar to the first time I visited, I loved my hair coming out.

After cutting my curls wet and combed straight she then fluffed pulled and and twirled my curls so it still looked blunt and even when I walked out but by the time I got home it was obvious she had not done what I had asked all, because the back is inches longer than the front. My hair is only barely shoulder length so it kind of looks like a mullet now that it's dry. 

I am really annoyed because she kept saying how easy of a request it was and how she didn't have to take very much off.... but she didn't do what I asked at all, as you can see in the photo that is NOT a blunt cut.

Brentwood at least always has plenty of employees who seem to spend their shifts talking to each other instead of customers. This one was pretty empty when I visited.

On several occasions, I've come in at fairly slow times and never been asked for help. As someone who works in retail, I know how important that is to sales, so it's surprising that management doesn't encourage customer engagement. 
One particular time, I came in looking for a specific hair tool. After circling the hair tool section about four times, I still couldn't find it and decided to ask somebody (because I had checked online and they said that they had the product in stock). I looked all around, and the only associates were either talking with each other or walking swiftly around. I decided to circle around a couple times, waiting for somebody to notice that I had been there for about 15 minutes now. The more I circled, the more annoyed I got. I decided to leave and go get my tool at the Walmart behind Ulta, which I found in less than 3 minutes of walking in.
Another time, the girl checking me out accidentally scanned the $50 palette I was purchasing twice and I didn't realize until after I got back to my car. When I returned, the girl looked annoyed and didn't offer any sort of apology as she refunded me. Once again, as somebody who works in retail, I can't understand the attitude she had with me and get annoyed that I didn't get an apology. Had I not noticed, I would have been charged $50!

Horrible experience with hair stylists DEB and MADISON. 

After my usual hair stylist was booked up for the rest of the month, I decided to take a chance with ULTA. 

I came into my noon appointment only to wait 45 min while Madison took in another client at MY appointment time. After my long wait, Deb sat me down and looked at my hair-- pulling and tugging on my ends. After examination, she decided it was far too ""damaged"" for her to do anything. She told me what I wanted done to my hair would look awful. Angry, I left and I am sure to never return. 

Interestingly, as I made an appointment with a REAL salon the next day, I got my hair done exactly how I wanted it and it turned out beautifully. 

I am so disappointed with ULTA, I went into my appointment excited and left in tears as my excitement was crushed by two stylists who deemed me as inconvenient.",2016,PA,Pensilvania,38.593953,-90.5056583,Y,8,0

I can spend two hours in there perusing the many aisles of cosmetics, shampoos, nail polishes, blow dryers, straighteners, etc. I can't get out of there without spending a small fortune, but that is not because they are over priced. It is because they have so many phenomenal products in one place that it is too hard for me to resist.

I used to go to Macy's or Nordstrom's for all of my cosmetics like Lancôme, Clinique and all my perfumes but they have quite a selection in Ulta and they do take coupons if you get on their mailing list. They also have a rewards program.

If I run out of mascara, it is a lot easier to run in and grab it from Ulta Beauty than it is to park and walk through the mall where at times I end up spending more on clothes because I discovered a good sale. 

There is always someone in Ulta Beauty to help you find what you are looking for.

I noticed I was charged $30 over. I went back in the store and asked for her to fix the issue. 

At this time she was ruder than before. She didn't fully explain what was happening with the ""void"" or ""refund"".

Luckily, there was an immediate opening (and it was a Saturday late afternoon). I had never been to an Ulta salon before - just looked curiously at it while shopping. The salon workers all seemed pretty friendly. (Thought it was kind of weird that they all had randomly colored hair in pinks/blues/etc. I guess it is close to Easter time...maybe they were trying to market colored dyes?) My hairstylist was Felicia - she had blue tinged, long black hair. She was very nice, made conversation with me, gave me a bottle of water, listened to what I wanted and even recommended a tattoo artist when I asked her about her tattoos. My hair came out exactly how I wanted it (past shoulders, blunt cut with a few layers and some bangs - from all long layers). Then she blew dry it all sexy and ready to go out (too bad I was just going to run errands with the family). I will definitely go back to her again!  Price is probably average for a midrange salon. 

As for the retail side of it. I needed to get some foundation and was determined to get it as I had (also) put this off til the last minute. It took me FOREVER to get help. I walked around and around and around. There were salespeople helping others but also some that weren't who would walk right past me and ask someone else if they needed help (which they always did)! It was very frustrating! After at least 30 mins of this, I finally found a lady with a CK nametag on who said she could help me. She found me a foundation and I finally was able to get out of there.  Great place to get product - but make sure you know what you want before you go in or you may wait too long for help! Sephora and Ulta need to find their happy medium. Seems Sephora always has wayyy too many people wanting to help and Ulta has the opposite.

I spent four hours there today  and  since she couldn't  get  the color correct after two processes I got on my cell phone  to the ULTA  salon back in Sparks  to see if they could tell her how they did my hair.

The Tarte section is always extremely sparse, the testers are gross and old, and I have NEVER been greeted or approached by any employee. I'm not exaggerating. They seem to have representatives walking around, but they must be for a different company because I have never been greeted in that store.

I finally go up to a cashier with blond curly ombré blue hair to ask for help and this lady acted really snobby like I just ruined her day. I asked her if there were any more colors in the dermablend or the stilla foundation and she stated that dermablend is repackaging their product so she didn't know when they'd be stocked. So then she just looks at me. Ok, so I finally get her out from behind her register and she walks me over to stilla and points out their selections. I asked her for recommendations and what was comparable to the makeupforever foundation, and she told me that's at sephora and started to walk away. I asked her about the dermablend and she just sort of walked me over to the direction. Then she just kind of looked at me like she wanted a pat on the back for helping me.

I shopped here several times when I visited Tucson this summer. The selection is fantastic (sooo many tempting things!) and the staff is really friendly and helpful. 

I had a couple of problems using a coupon on the ULTA website (long story..the website simply would not let me use the coupon, no matter what I tried). So I brought the coupon with me into the store, and asked if there was any way I could use it there. Even though it was an online only coupon, the staff was sympathetic, and made sure that they found a way to give me the same discount. That was above and beyond the normal service level and very appreciated!

One of the girls also helped me choose a mascara, and she was very knowledgeable and friendly.

- sephora usually has a fuller staff to store and customer ratio. Sometimes so many that the look bored because the store is only so big
-ulta is the complete opposite, less staffed bigger store, more customers than availible sales associates... which all i have to say to that is..i get it!

I decided to browse while I wait. I noticed dirty/gross testers, no associates acknowledged me while I browsed, no one asked if I needed assistance or anything. 

Now I work in retail myself and I understand needing to get your job done with displays or whatever it may be. But really not even a ""Hello"" or a ""Can I help you?"" was said so it's just kind of appalling to see poor customer service. I walked through aisles looking at makeup while associates glanced over while continuing their project. 

I was testing makeup on the back of my hand and needed a tissue to wipe it off...I couldn't find a single stand w clean tissues or cotton. There were plenty of used cosmetic supply strewn on displays. It was really off putting. Makeup testers out or dried up/funky smells. 

I had a great experience last year I went there to get my nails done. The girl did everything you would do for a manicure. This time on the other hand was different. When I went in the other day, my nails came out looking like I had painted them quickly before I came into the salon. 

No soaking of nails to soften skin, no pushing back of cuticles..you know the regular routine of a manicure. I felt bad calling back because the the woman who did my nails was SUPER friendly and nice. We had a lovely conversation too. But I didn't feel like she knew what she was doing all the way.

I rarely write bad reviews, but this Ulta is just not the place to get a haircut. I am new to the area and so I got two haircuts at Ulta before deciding that the convenient location and low price wasn't worth it.

For both haircuts--with two different stylists--they told me that they ""preferred cutting dry"" and so didn't wash or blow dry my hair. This doesn't reduce the price, however, and I feel like it's just a convenient way for the stylist to get out of the time-consuming wash and blow dry. Also, on my first visit the stylist asked me if I wanted it straightened and since I do normally straighten my hair I said yes. When I went to pay I noticed she added a $10 charge to the bill! So, she didn't give me half of the haircut (the wash and blow dry) but added extra to the total price. 

For both haircuts I wanted a normal cut with long layers just to make it lay nicely, and both stylists did a crazy amount of layering in my hair that I definitely didn't ask for. The first stylist mentioned that I had a ""mom haircut"" and talked about all the crazy things that happen in IV where she lives. The second stylist told me that my side part looked like ""TV anchor hair."" Who are these people?

Anyways, I'm not sure if my experiences are common for all Ulta's , or just this one, as I've only ever shopped here. The positives-- they have a lot of diversity between various lines and price points. If you want a black eye liner, you can spend $6 for a great one from Prestige, or $20 for a good one from Urban Decay. Same with hair care products, which I generally avoid because I'm terrible at doing my hair.

The negatives-- this store is really slow to receive new product. I've been checking for weeks to see when they will get new shades of L'Oreal Infallible e/s. I finally gave up and visited a few local drugstores (Rite-Aid, CVS, and Walgreens) until I found the new color in stock. Ulta, as of today, still doesn't have the new collection! Uhg. Also, they are slow to put out new collections. They had mailed out the free Clinique lipstick mailer *before* unboxing and setting up their new Clinique counter. What the heck? I had to wait a few weeks before returning and redeeming my free lipstick coupon.

Also, the sales people. Oh, the sales people....they are nice at best. Most of them are not informed and don't have much training. It's probably not their fault, but the store. I know Sephora has a lot more training for their employee's, so if I actually want to bother asking a sales person about something, I would go to Sephora or Nordstrom's, *not* Ulta.

The best part about Ulta's is their coupons. You can use a $3.50/off coupon (minimum purchase $10, drugstore items only, not prestige cosmetics) and a 20%-off one item coupon in the same transaction...mix that in with some of their buy one, get one 50% off deals and you just saved yourself a pretty penny.

(Did she notice I have green eyes or was this simply a coincidence?) While the customer service is far lacking compared to Sephora, it was fun come home with a bag of goodies for ten bucks! 

That said, customer service needs some polishing. Never having visited an ULTA store, I wanted to peruse the ULTA brand cosmetics, but an employee re-stocking that display happened to have a bunch of boxes, etc right in front of it. I kind of felt in his way, and wish he had simply looked up, said hello or smiled. Moving on to another aisle, a woman did finally acknowledge my presence and ask if I needed assistance. (Turns out she was the one who later rang up my purchases, so perhaps they are short-staffed?) I asked her opinion on a particular shade of brow pencil I was considering - she agreed it was too dark for me. Then walked away.  At Sephora they take you to the display, show you better selections for your coloring, then offer to apply it so you can see before you buy. (I never did purchase one...)

I visited Ulta in Orange County a few years ago, long before we got one in Santa Barbara. And no words capture the wonderfulness of this large, immaculate, shiny palace of beauty. 

I don't go much as it's out in Goleta by Costco and I have no reason to schlep out there. But PUR is the last tinted moisturizer I will wear for the rest of my life. If they go out of business, I will buy 20 tubes to hold me for a decade until a product comes to fill the void. 

It's 34 dollars and provides all the coverage I need at this point in my life. 

I bought a curling iron in the OC and it's terrific. And they have an enormous fragrance collection, from Escada to Burberry to Coach to Dior. The only fragrance they don't carry that I know of is Tom Ford. 

And the service is unequalled. The girls are so friendly and they know their stuff intimately. I bought for  64 dollars 1.7 ounces of Burberry Brit Sheer. It was only 12 dollars more than the 1 ounce: nearly double the quantity for just a little more! The woman also showed me an atomizer (refillable and washable) you can take on the plane for just 10 dollars. 

Unlike Sephora, which is rushed, cramped, and loud with often very irritating clubby music, Ulta is a joy to visit and they have all kinds of cutesy impulse buys at the counter. On your birthday month, you receive double points. And you don't have to mess with parking in Paseo Nuevo as you do for Sephora. It's not that the girls at Sephora aren't nice, but they are understaffed and at Ulta, you can really explore and ask questions. 

I cannot say enough for this store and do not understand the low Yelp rating at all.

I recommend browsing online or another local provider for their offerings rather than stopping in unless you know which specific product you want here!

The ""cheaper"" side of Ulta carries about 8-10 brands, but it's likely that a a fair number of those products are not well stocked. I tried to find a brow pencil in brown and wasn't tied to any brand, but it took looking through 5 separate brands to find a stocked selection. The same has happened for concealers, foundations, and lip colors -- you find the price point, style, and shade in a tester, then you realize the product you want isn't actually available to buy and take home.

Some of my frustrations with this store are related to the brands, not Ulta's, setup but it goes hand-in-hand. For example, it's awesome to see a beautiful display of $10 lipsticks, but then it's likely that none of them are sealed and there are no designated test products to open and look at the colors. Most sections don't have a single ""tester"", meaning *any* of the unsealed products could have been swatched... and it's not fun thinking about buying a product someone else has already tested.

When I'm at a beauty store like Ulta, I want to hear the wisdom of the make-up experts who work there and get their input. But at this location, I feel like you have to hunt them down and directly say ""I would like to spend $x on Y. What should I get?"" and the response and helpfulness has been widely varying, most often leaning toward seeming inconvenienced. This location always seems understaffed, weather you're looking for specific products or you're waiting in their longggg line to check out.

*Here are A few things that would embarrass me to the point of...
DOING SOMETHING TO MAKE A CHANGE! taking into account the awful reviews, recognizing a pattern of issues that should have gotten the attention they deserve, to better this location, to make shopping enjoyable again.
*Always understaffed; overwhelming employees & noticeably stressing them out effecting their customer services...
*Positions are constant revolving doors including all job positions inside the store & salon, excluding Clinique & Benefit counters...
*I have witnessed store MANAGERS speak inappropriately & unprofessionally TO their staff and ABOUT them. Negative & unnecessary 'gossip' IN the middle of the store at a time with lots of traffic flowing in and out, with no effort to be discreet or anything... (as I was being checked-out I see another Manager, this one being unbelievably rude so much so the poor employee was silent with tears flowing and in front of a long line of customers... (Again, unprofessional!!)
*Ulta Beauty is a great Beauty store with a great variety/great products-- I wish Ulta HQ starts becoming pro-active, recognizing just how many of us customers leave the store baffled by our negative experiences (whether spending hundreds or $5). 
*Most importantly I really hope someone reads this review who can possibly HELP THIS ULTA LOCATION, bring back something I think any customer appreciates; CARING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CUSTOMER IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE SHOPPING IN YOUR STORES!****",2017,LA,Luisiana,34.42947658,-119.87175968,Y,6,1

And thank goodness for salespeople like Christina who are there to guide us all through the many bits of glamour. This store has absolutely everything for pretty much every part of your body. And from head to toe there is something for everyone.

I actually went in with high hopes for finishing up my Christmas shopping, and got totally sidetracked with trying to find a signature scent for myself. Did I find one? No . . . but after pretty much spritzing every part of my body with several different manly sprays I think I may have it narrowed down to less than a dozen choices.

I was able to pretty much wrap up the rest of my Christmas shopping right here, and Christina helped me keep focus as we looked at my list, checked it twice, and ended up finding way more that I had anticipated. Who knew that beauty products can be so much fun to learn about. Christina totally opened up my eyes and mind to specialty beauty products that I never knew existed.

All I know is that I have never been so excited to have my family open the many gifts I purchased here. They too will also think that my inner-drag-queen had come out when selecting these items.

So, not only was the item NOT in stock, the person I talked to said that it wasn't something she'd seen in MONTHS. So, wasted trip.

While I was there, I noticed there was an item that I usually use that had a great gift with purchase and it was worth it to me to get it.  The date of the gift with purchase was that day through about a week. This is important because it was literally the first day of the gift and it was about 20 minutes after the store opened. 

When I got to the register, I had to ask for the gift (it didn't automatically come up) and I was told they didn't have it. I asked them if they had a substitute and two salespeople looked through their stock to see if they could give me anything that would be comparable. I got nothing and still bought the item because I was embarrassed to say I didn't want it without the gift. Despite the fact that the gift was why I had decided to get it that day. 

In addition to the Case of the Missing Gifts (this has happened every time I've tried to redeem a coupon or advertised gift at this particular location) they had super messy shelves and empty shelves all over the store. I'm not sure if they're closing soon or if they just can't be bothered to clean up or restock. If they aren't closing, what does it say that they look like they are?

Also, ordering through the app prevents impulse shoppers (like me) from mindlessly shoveling a ton of products I don't need into my basket! 

For online orders, you have the option to skip the line, as well. There's a little desk right by the front door that's labeled ""Pick up."" In total, it takes about 1-2 minutes to get everything! You just need to show the order number (found in the confirmation email) and a driver's license. This genius set up reduces time spent in the store, and makes the transaction significantly more efficient. 

As for the customer service, I have only ever had positive experiences here. I've lived in Goleta for over a decade, and have been coming to this store religiously since it first opened (not a fan of Sephora). The people who work there are helpful and welcoming, but not over-the-top-breathing-down-your-neck friendly (thank goodness). In my opinion, there's nothing worse than people hovering!

I used to see Ulta's coupons in the Sunday paper and take stock of anything I needed.  Unfortunately, the coupons only apply to non-prestige brands, Ulta's included.  There are so many exclusions on those coupons that the ""deal"" itself might as well be null and void.  Totally a flaw in the company's policy if it is aiming to compete with the department stores in Oxford Valley, and more importantly: Sephora. 

With the exception of the person who used to wax my brows at the Benefit Brow Bar -- before she left -- became the only reason I would go here.  Otherwise, I've met happier people stocking shelves at the grocery store!  One night I walked in after I was at the gym and asked if the Urban Decay Naked eyeshadow palette was in stock.  Both employees just turned to each other as if we were in an episode of the Three Stooges.  Either they didn't know one of the store's major brands or they had never seen someone in sneakers and exercise clothes.  The girls hastily told me it wasn't in the store, yet there was a tester palette sitting in the aisle where Urban Decay was displayed.  Since it was going to take a Herculean effort to look in the computer or in the stock room, I just walked out and gave my business to Sephora.

A month or two later, I revisited in the afternoon, and went for my brow waxing.  This my brow girl's last day and I couldn't say I blamed her.  I paid immediately after the service since her shift was over, then I went looking for an eyeliner.  I scanned the aisles for the product and someone who could help me since the cashier said she could not leave the register.  No problem.  I noticed an employee in the back where the salon is located, though I needed to use a bathroom, so I asked the cashier if there was one.  She called over the person I had seen near the salon who had the key, then let me in.  After I was finished, I told the person I was out, and she was actually very friendly.  When I asked her about the product I was looking for, she told me she could not leave the salon.  Again, I understand, so I took another once-over down the aisle.  

With no luck, I headed for the door, and that's when I was confronted by an employee.  ""Excuse me, I saw you wandering around and I'm going to need you to open your bag.""  She had this shit-eating grin on her face like she was going to get Employee of the Year for busting a shoplifter.  It was alarming, yet I kept my cool and replied, ""Melissa waxed my brows, the cashier let me into the bathroom, here is the recei-...""  

""OPEN YOUR BAG.""

Now this woman is in my face, basically trying to bully me into her own version of search and seizure.  You got a warrant to go with that name tag, too?  So, extremely offended, I opened my bag and showed her the receipt, as well as moving aside my wallet and other personal items to prove her theory wrong.  I guess some mental breakthrough occurred because all of a sudden, she softens with, ""Oh, I saw you wandering around...""  to which I cut her off with, ""Yes, because no one is on the floor to help any customers, then I asked the cashier to use the bathroom, which she and your coworker in the salon can confirm.""

I didn't stick around to hear Ms. Justice's reply because you know what?  Just because a customer is young, DOES NOT mean he/she is going to steal.  Since then, I've taken my business to Flirt Beauty in Yardley and Bensalem, and other *worthy* local shops.

Ulta was the only salon open on Sunday and I got an appointment with Karen (thanks to previous reviewer Nicole for the positive review of Karen's work, I felt hopeful and more confident because of it). When Karen saw my hair she immediately told me not to worry, that she was going to fix everything and it would look a thousand times better. She was wrong - it looks a million times better! She foiled my hair using a technique I've never seen before and then used a different dye on the hair outside the foils. She used two different glazes as well.

However I have never seen my hair look so beautiful and so straight, as when Mary Jane did it for me...it even lasted until the next day and it was raining the night we did it!  

I loved what she did with my hair so much that when my mom was visiting on vacation I made an appointment for the two of us. We both had color and I had highlights and we left looking like movie stars. My mom felt 15 years younger and if I do say so, I thought she looked 20 years younger myself.  My father even complimented her! (which is both rare and amazing).

It did not feel like a spa-they waxed my brows at a freaking hair washing sink with a plastic tub full of supplies they pulled out of a cabinet. Nothing was set up for waxing, it felt like I was getting a wax out of the trunk of a car. On top of that, hey charged two dollars more then the Benefit bar. The girl, Rebecca, was sweet. However, I told her exactly what I wanted and I mentioned multiple times that I thought she was taking too much off and what did she do? Take too much off. Not happy with the outcome at all.

I'd probably give the rest of the store 3 stars because the staff, not including specialty staff (Benefit, Dermalogica, etc.), are very rude and make it very aware how much they hate their jobs. Anyway, here's the review for the brow bar:

Michelle is a GODSEND! I went into Ulta looking like Frida Kahlo and *thankfully* Michelle had an open spot to fill before her next client. I explained how I just couldn't find someone who could get the right shape for my brow (or any shape really) and that I wanted a natural look as opposed to being permanently surprised. She laughed and assured me that she would fix everything up. That was an understatement. My brows are now absolute perfection. I can't stop staring at them. After she tweezed (wax irritates my skin) and trimmed them, she filled them in with the Benefit products, not once pushing me to buy anything. The best part of the whole experience was the great conversation we had while she was reconstructing my face. Michelle was so nice and hilarious and I could have sat there all day chatting. 

I'm so glad that I took a chance and switched up my brow routine! Michelle is definitely my new go-to-girl now that I have fabulous brows that need maintaining.",2014,ID,Idaho,40.1851779,-74.8651605472,Y,12,1

Mid way through my appointment I smelled alcohol on her breath and when she arrived late to my appointment she had a blue slushy and it all kinda made sense. I wish I would've said something when I smelled it but because I was just trying to fix my hair and get out I let her keep going. (I was there for 3 and a half hours) We both had agreed to only cut off what was necessary.

She butchered the back putting in short layers on my what I would consider to be long hair. It was so choppy that she went back in with her texturizing shears and TOOK MORE OFF.

I've went through hell and back with my hair in 2017, and I was feeling really good about being at this salon in general. The vibes felt great, the salon didn't make me feel off or uncomfortable. The good vibes were there! 

My best friend knows how scared I am of hair stylists because of how much I went through in the last year. So I had a really tough semester, and wanted to make myself feel good about myself again. I fell into this rut, and I was exhausted, sad, and overall over 2017. 

There were two photos that I showed my stylist, Heather, as to what I wanted. She consulted me about the color choice beforehand. Let me know what happens to fashion color etc. I've been into fashion color for some time now, and have been dying to go pink!  

I wanted my roots to be left alone because I was pre-lightened, and I just wanted some fun color done. Heather has such a great personality! I hope she never leaves, because I'm definitely becoming a regular. Fairless Hills is quite a hike from me. I'm near Northern Liberties in Philadelphia, PA, but I'll drive anywhere for quality service! I have an appointment with her again, March 9th, and I'm ecstatic that I chose someone I already trust to do what's next. 

She really seems like she knows what she's doing; I'm so glad she made me pink, and the pink came out amazingly! It lasted over 2 months, and she also recommended me some awesome dry shampoos. With her consulting, I made my pink last a long time! I was obsessed, and still obsessed; everyone was obsessed. I felt so magical and fun! I work in a conservative environment, but they were over the moon with it! They loved it and were accepting of it considering my reasons for getting it.

She offered have them re-done, but I just wanted a refund.  Even when I've had decent gel manicures at Ulta I've been disappointed by how long it takes.

Things to Consider:
Like one of the reviews stated this is more of a self service location. If you know your beauty products and makeup you will do okay and Ulta and able to get in and out. If you need more help in cheaper brands, beauty products and etc then you may find it hard to get a little help. On the other hand in the makeup department for the non Ulta brands you will find the best chances for help at this location. 

I love this location because there is a salon and a Benefit Brow Bar, which are important in my world and probably get all of my money. They bought offer pretty reasonably priced services and most important quick. The turnaround on services here is great especially when they stick to appointments. If you are looking to get your hair down ask for GiGi she is the queen of the blowout and style. For Eyebrows definitely let Maria do them.

Another great thing about this location is brands brands brands. They tend to stay stocked with my favorites along with others such as a pretty massive Smashbox section as well as Benefit section. You will also see other brands such as Urban Decay and Still among many others in the makeup department. There is a reasonable sized skin scare section. I often don't see much help in this area so it can be frustrating trying to figure it out.  Another good thing about this location is there is lotttttttttttttttts of hair products. Whatever your needs are they probably have it to get your hair together.

I'm just happy they have this location in the city. The staff is friendly and definitely efficient and I have not had any problems at all.

I liked being able to buy inexpensive brands that are tried & true next to the higher end items. I did have a sales associate offer assistance on the high end side but she seemed stressed and so I said no thanks. There was no one offering help on the more crowded drugstore brand side.

I was disappointed by the messiness/empty shelves. Maybe this place has been slammed since opening a few months ago...oh wait, it's been almost 7 months, so they should have their act together.

I threw the new cashier off because I had two coupons* at check out.  That's OK, she's new, the store is new, and I was patient.  She had to call a manager over and, here is where the bad taste was put in my mouth, the manager not only barked rudely at the cashier, she literally berated every worker around her.  Is this the way to start out a new store?  You could already tell every underling was completely alienated from said manager.  2nd day? Really?

They had a nice selection of, well, everything. BUT, I could not get over the shabby treatment of the employees who were more than nice to me.  I can only believe the employee turnover will be high.

My imagined truth is that this mean manager is a high-level executive from corporate and she is here temporarily to open the store.  Hopefully the real manager is from New Orleans, awesome, and I will return in 3 weeks and witness the happiest employees ever.   I'll let you know...

I like to browse around on my own, so I don't need a tour of the place and if I'm stopping in to pick up product that's running low, I'm all about the grab and go.  However, on this particular visit, I wanted to get some insight on concealer.  Long story short, as I read through 50 different descriptions to find a concealer I could live with, while the staff discussed scheduling and the high costs of ultrasounds.  I must have wandered around for 20 minutes and not one of them looked at me as they pondered the difficulty of setting regular hours in retail.  Granted, no one there is a dermatologist, so it's no like I missed out on anything, but isn't the point of being a specialized store the fact that you offer in-depth, personal service to clients.  Aren't the associates trained to be (or appear to be) subject matter experts?

I know some people probably go broke in here. I'm going to try to stay away because I could easily get hooked.

While there yesterday and the day before, I saw so many different brands from so many different celebrities and people I learned about through YouTube right alongside the brands that have been around for years. There is something for everyone. 

Upon entering the store, there were several people mulling around the front door. I couldn't figure out what exactly was going on. I'm guessing the store was having a party, team meeting, or maybe they just happened to be there at the time I entered. I'm not sure if one of those many people greeted me or if they were even employees. But as I made my way further into the store, an associate asked whether or not I needed anything. I declined and continued on the search for the specific product I had come for. 

The shelf had a spot and price tag for the product I'd come for but there was nothing there. There were similar products by the same manufacturer next to the empty spot so I decided to look for someone to assist me. This turned out to be a small challenge. I couldn't find anyone in that area of the store. I walked around the general area trying to figure out who worked there and who didn't. Finally, two ladies appeared about the same time at a counter in the rear of the store. I asked if perhaps the product might be in the back and one of them went to check. She returned with the last one in the store which was wonderful. I returned to the front to check out.  The line area has lots of last minute temptations, but once again, I was thankful that none of it interested me.  There were two or three people checking customers out and one or two more doing different things in the register area. I've concluded that getting customers out the door is not a number one priority here.

Although the store is well organized, sections are clearly designated, and lighting is perfect, if employees had a uniform look, a smock, or if this huge store had little stations where customers could summons assistance, it would be helpful for those of us who are not experts in ""beauty"". 

I ended up needing to return the item I purchased because I was not satisfied with it. I looked online for Ulta's return policy and was delighted to find out that I would have no trouble getting a refund even though he item had been opened and used, and could not be resold. They have a very fair and accommodating return policy.

The store has more than just make up. It has curling irons, blow dryers, waxing kits, lighted mirrors, facial equipment, the list goes on and on. After returning home, I received an email survey about my experience. Through the survey, I learned that they offer services. I had no idea. But yeah, they offer hair and skin services and even make up. 

I will say it one more time:  I'm so glad I'm not into make up because this store has way too much stuff and it looks like it could be fun.",2019,TN,Tennessee,29.9611092426,-90.1856499528,Y,12,0

Given my love for makeup, I've always loved Ulta because they have such a wide variety of not just high end products but drugstore products as well. I also like the layout better than Sephora (not as cluttered, brighter, more spacious). With that said, I'm not a fan of this location. The products are great, the store is clean, but each time I've been here the employees haven't been helpful at all. They can typically be found in a corner gossiping and when I've asked them for help (e.g. Where are your dry shampoos? Where are your self tanners?), they come across bothered. And I'm not someone that necessarily expects a salesperson to come
up to me asking if I need help, but when I do ask for help, at the very least I expect help in return without an attitude.

It's a shame because if the employees were friendlier this review would be five stars instead of two stars, but every time I go to this location I leave with a bad taste in my mouth.

Long story short, I know makeup. I've done makeup for weddings, proms, models, etc. My specialty is skin/complexion, so I KNOW the difference between warm/cool/neutral foundations. With that said, I went in today because I had a coupon and wanted to get some more foundations.

Again, I know my undertones. So I began talking to the NARS rep and decided to purchase the sheer glow foundation-one of my favorites. I told him I wanted one shade just slightly darker than my skin because I get spray tans but that I still wanted it to be in the warm/golden family-I then pointed at the shade Punjab because I've owned it before and know it's my perfect shade. He then questioned me and said ""um you mean something with a rosy/cool undertone then? Because Punjab is rosy and a warmer shade will be too yellow for you."" This was after I told him I do makeup, so it came across a bit demeaning-as if I don't really know what I'm talking about. I kind of just nodded my head and said ""sure"" because I didn't want to come across mean, but I was confused. He then put Punjab on me and just like I said, it matched me perfectly. I ended up purchasing Punjab and their concealer in the shade cannelle. He kept referring to them as ""rosy""

When I got home, I immediately googled the two shades on NARS site to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and they are described as ""golden"" and ""peachy"" (see attached photos).

So why am I writing this? 1. Because although the NARS rep was nice, I didn't like his comments 2. If you're going to have a NARS rep at your store, he/she should at least be able to properly tell the difference between undertones and not improperly refer to shades as being something they are not.

All in all, my experiences at this location have been way too hit or miss for me to definitively give them more than 2 stars. Sorry Ulta, but until you get your act together I'm officially done visiting your Elmwood location.",2018,TN,Tennessee,29.9611092426,-90.1856499528,Y,4,0

It's clean, well-lit and signage is well-viewable. Many sales associates are on the floor. I was greeted upon arrival, and numerous associates asked if I needed assistance.

Everything was all fine and good, until I got to checkout.

A woman was checking out, and asked how to use a particular item she was buying. That wasn't the cashier's fault, but the explanation went on and on.

Then, the cashier decided to do an upsell of some associated item that she would ""swear on."" And was it a Chatty Cathy sales pitch!

Now, five people were standing in line to check out. I was #2. #1 turned around and looked at me. We shared ""The Look."" No other cashiers came to operate another register.

I left the line, returned my would-be three purchases to their respective homes, and walked out.

As I walked out, I turned at looked at #1. We were both laughing, and upsell was continuing.

There's nothing wrong with upsell. We can all spot it, and we expect it. BUT PLEASE don't do it at checkout. Do it on the floor.",2017,AZ,Arizona,38.6787815,-90.462162,Y,9,0

They won't budge to ask if you need help, whatever. If I want it, I'll go look for you. 
Howeevvveerrr, there is a man who works in the salon area who is very helpful and knowledgeable! I wish I knew his name.. He has facial piercings, that is all I can remember. Anyways, I walked up to the wall o' hair care looking for purple shampoo. I will be the first to admit I know nothing about my hair. I had the Redken brand on my hand when he approached and asked if I needed help. ""Yeeeesssss thank you!!!"" 
He showed me three of the top brands and explained the different pros and cons of each. He definitely made me feel very confident that I made the right purchase. 
Later on, a different employee came up to me and complimented me on my shoes (why thank you) and just all around it was an awesome shopping experience. 
Not to say every time is this enjoyable and heart warming though.. This past weekend I was looking for a specific eyeshadow palette from Too Faced. I couldn't find a spot that even said Peanut Butter so I asked an employee if the Too Faced palettes were any where else in the store, to which she quickly snapped at me, ""No. We are all sold out of peanut butter.""

It's service like this that makes stores like Ulta and sephora seem unapproachable, but if you know what you're looking for, you'll find it.  What I was truly happy about was that I found that Urban Decay lipsticks were 50% off due to them being discontinued for re-boxing. New packaging means a great bargain.

This way I could try what I wanted, be helped by someone who was familiar with the products, and purchase them right there. I was quite excited the first time I attempted to go, and left feeling not so great. There were three employees working, and two were talking, and one was stocking or going over products at the counter. I couldn't get a person, and after a while, I left. My second visit I had a similar experience, except I did get a person to talk to me after I followed her around, and felt I annoyed her by asking a question. I was looking for a pretty specific product, and if You've been to Ulta before, you know that sending someone down an isle to look is not much help. When I looked like I couldn't find it, she came over and pointed to everything around there, and said ""these are all in the same catagory"", not what I wanted whatsover. Again, she was stocking, and didn't want to help I would have liked to try something, but she was pretty rude, and I wouldn't have wanted her help even had she offered it (which she didn't). My third time there (yes, possibly stupidity), I happen to pass it (it's in a mall), and saw three woman at the counter, and crossed my fingers and toes. I walked in and spent my usual ten minutes there, not knowing where anything was, and wondering if they really do show people how to use their makeup, because I had never seen it. Im not sure if it's just that location, but as one who tends to spend money on makeup, I was pretty astounded, and wondered if they ever had a manager around. Had I been one around, there would be three people looking for a job, or much better trained. At the least acknowledge a person is in your store, especially considering you have to walk right past the desk when you enter the store. Personally, I would rather buy makeup from Walgreens, until I am in Tampa and can go where they seem to care about selling a product, or making a commission, or maybe they just enjoy their jobs, but in any event, three times is one time more than I usually give, and It won't happen again!!!  BY the way, just for the record, when I was there all three times, the store was empty.

Which is terrible, cause when buying make-up it's nice to see the colors and product before you buy it.

I've never gone in and there not been a line wrapping into the store from the registers. And it's not like they are under staffed... It's because several employees are not at the register. There was one specific time when they manager or shift leading employee was called (through the headsets) from the one girl left to tend to the registers alone 3x for help. She finally came to assist, and then decided to carry on a personal conversation (she was friends with the guest she rang up) for 5 minutes when there was still 3 more people in line. Leaving the other girl to the line again while she just talked... I finally made it to the register, and she picked up a call (which had been ringing for quite sometime) rather than help me.

Unbelievable... I try to continue shopping here and she still acts like this when I give multiple other chances.

I did use their beauty services and we're pleased. That's where the 2 stars come from. If you book online it is easy to get an appointment that fits your schedule.

I had two coupons, so when I went to check out I asked to do two separate transactions so I could use both coupons, which the cashier had no problems with. Unfortunately, the second item I purchased I couldn't use a coupon on because it was a prestige make up product, but he did give me the coupon back so I could save it for later or share with a friend.

Sadly, since I initially posted my review, I've been dealing with severe breakage (pieces that are 2 - 3"" long, even after being forced to cut almost 3"" off!). 

I get angry every time I look in the mirror - my hair is hideous looking, and will be for months!!!

And I resent that the salon manager said they'll use this experience as a ""learning opportunity"" for the stylist who ruined my hair...really? That girl needs to go back to school (her name is Kimberly, by the way...do not book with her unless it's a simple cut or blow out). 

*********************

Warning - do NOT go to the hair salon there!

I went to have some of my roots touched up (I was blonde up until this incident, about 2 weeks ago), get a color gloss, and a cut. I had been doing my own hair for months, and it was in good shape and condition before I walked into the salon. 

I was assigned a stylist (who I found out during my service that she had very little experience and wasn't yet 21...which is why she didn't take what I was telling her about my hair seriously). 

She bleached the roots, but the bleach didn't take. I mentioned that the product wasn't doing what it was supposed to, but she said it was a self-timed product and would stop processing automatically (FYI - the bleaching process didn't lighten my roots at all - but she left it on long enough to fry my hair, pretty severely). 

She rinsed out the product and went to prep the gloss shade (I had asked for something more platinum vs yellow. I also know a gloss needs to stay in the hair for at least 15 minutes.). Less than 30 seconds after she applied it, she was finding it out. I jokingly said ""the color must be taking"" and she said ""yeah"". Then I asked, ""shouldn't this be on my hair longer?"". Her response was that since she saw the color depositing, she could rinse it out.

She then took me back to the chair and said she was going to trim my hair and even out the layers. I specifically asked her not to take off any of the length or cut my bangs. She barely cut any of my hair, but what she did cut ended up looking like a mullet! And because if her poor bleaching technique my hair has such extreme breakage - I'm losing so much hair every day (and I'm getting depressed looking in the mirror everyday to see how badly she destroyed my hair). 

I went back to my darker color a few days after my appointment because it will prevent me from having to color it as frequently vs when I was blonde. 

I did call the salon the day after and spoke with the salon manager. I let her know about all the issues, and how bad my hair was (the stylist took so much off from the top of my scalp area that it sticks straight up! Now I realize she was trying to hide the fact that my hair was breaking off so much from her poor technique.

I'm giving 2 stars because they did, without incident, give me a full refund for the service. 

But I'm utterly disgusted that now I'm spending just as much on deep conditioning treatments to minimize the amount of breakage.

I LOVE this ULTA!  Its one of the largest stores Ive been to and has a lot of products that the smaller ones may not have.  This ULTA is also at Coolsprings Mall so its super convenient to just pop in while I'm at the mall for other stuff.  Ill be honest, its never really a ""pop in"", its usually what I like to call a meandering.  My husband knows that if I'm going into ULTA its going to be a long wait or he should have something to do while I meander.  If youre a lover of all things makeup and hair like myself you get what I'm trying to say! For all those men out there DONT FEEL LEFT OUT!! They have an entire section of mens products from Shampoo to Cologne! So if you need to smell nice for your significant other then you can pop in and one of the great ULTA associates will help you find exactly what you need! OR if you need a great stocking stuffer....and ULTA gift card is NEVER a bad thing!! (ur welcome ladies!)

ULTA has everything, bodywash, shampoos, styling tools, perfume, makeup(over the counter and higher end), and so so SO much more...this is why its a meander and not a pop in. lol. The staff at this ULTA are amazing and always willing to help when needed but also happy to leave you to your own devices which is nice in my opinion.  Sometimes I like to try something new and being left to do that without a sales pitch makes it that much easier to do that, but I know that if I have a product question they are there and ready.  They also carry higher end makeup selections and usually have an expert for that brand in store so color matching and asking specific questions is a breeze! 

Overall I will always choose ULTA for my products because the return policy is amazing.  If you purchase a product and don't like it, its not the right color, its doesn't work well for you, or u have a reaction to it, return it! Even if you have used the product a couple times you can return it, that's nice when you have sensitive skin and things don't always work for you.

So pop in and meander around, get your brows done and find a new product you didn't even know you needed!! They have millions of them to choose from! Im sure ill see you there lol.",2019,IN,Indiana,35.95469913,-86.81443691,Y,11,1

The girl was really nice which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. I get eyelash extensions all the time and had to go here for a last minute emergency but now I'm in an even bigger emergency... eyelash-less. She went really fast which made me a little skeptical from the start. I don't know where she learned or where that went wrong but she glued them to my actual lashes... biggest mistake. Anyone who has even so much as had this procedure done before knows that you glue to the skin in between the lashes to avoid lash-loss. Anyway, within a day or 2 the extensions were so tangled, upside down, twisted, and just plain old ridiculous looking, but bearable. But then after about a week they started to clump together so bad and formed this ball of glue/ gunk at the root of my real lashes to the point of pain with every blink. I tried every at home remedy to get them off safely but without fail it would take my lashes with them. So I stopped trying and am now waiting for them to come off naturally... if that will even happen. In the meantime I guess I'll just look like a scarecrow and try not to blink so much :)

When my skin really needs a glow, I go for tinted moisturizer, specifically Laura Mercier or Stila. Unfortunately, this Ulta does not carry either product, bummer! I did not see any Laura Mercier products although they had a big wall of Stila products.

An employee helped me to find a different BB cream, from Smashbox. He did not really do a great job talking it up or exploring my options, and I felt like he was just going through the motions and did not really give a crap. I remembered that the Hello Flawless Oxygen Foundation by Benefit received good reviews, so a different employee helped me pick out one of those in my shade.

I have never had an issue and love the lash tech but always wondered how much and how often they practiced hygiene and sanitation because the girl never wore gloves, I never saw her wash her hands, clean tools etc. I trusted them Until my last appointment right before xmas/December 2019. The lash tech had been out/not at work for a few months and when she came back it wasnt the same. My lashes/eyelids were itching and hurting for a few days. After about a week I removed the lashes because I couldn't take it-- lash tech said it was the new glue. I went back about 2 weeks later in early January 2020 to get them redone. This time they looked better and felt better except the very next morning I woke up with PINK EYE. I contacted the lash tech/sent her pictures and advised her so no one else would have the experience. She said she would talk to her manager & offered to redo them .... but why would I want to risk another eye infection. I never heard anything back from her or the manager. I contacted ULTA 2 weeks after speaking with the Tech & the manager said she had not heard of the incident. I asked for a refund and at first it was if she didn't believe me... i said look I have proof--Urgent care diagnosis, pictures of my eyes, and screenshots of the conversation between me and the lash tech. I got my lashes done late afternoon Sunday and woke up for work Monday morning at 7am and could barely open my eye. The manager was nice about it though, she contacted her Manager and they said they would give me refund. I was grateful until i went to get it and made some other in-store beauty purchases the manager automatically credited it to purchase instead of  asking if I wanted it back on my card /cash etc. I have also had all bad hair experiences here in the Salon. Would not recommend ULTA for Salon purposes. The 1 star is for the products offered  and how nice all the Cherry Hill employees are at the registers.

The samples that they have for people to swatch the more high end products are DISGUSTING and look old and like kids (or messy adults) have slammed their fingers into them. I would never put my hands anywhere near that stuff. Also, they should have tissue next to the samples so that if I do decide to swatch it on my hand, I can wipe it off when I'm done.

That woman gave me two totally unfamiliar eyebrows, one being a straight line and the otherbeing shaped like an upside down U. There comes a point (especially) particularly ABSOLUTELY with regards to eyebrows that if somebody effs up your eyebrows once you do not give them a second chance. DO NOT LET them fix it I repeat DO NOT LET THEM NEAR YOUR BROWS. They can't fix it they messed up to begin with. That's when you either have to resort to doing it yourself or going to somebody else to have them fix it. Such was the case with this trip to Ulta.  First it took her 20 minutes to do it and I swear had had it not been for the pain and ripping sound I would not have known that she did anything to my eyebrows at all. She literally scrubbed them with her dry cotton pad for probably half the time and in the end they looked oily but there was no shape. none whatsoever. It was ironic because she was telling me as she was doing my eyebrows that a woman had messed up her eyebrows, so I'm not sure if this was some sort of revenge thing like The Ring where the only way to get rid of the bad brows is to give somebody else bad brows.  I don't know. And the cost? Ridiculous! $21 for a mediocre brow wax when there are literally three kiosks within 50 feet of that store that do twice as good a job for half the amount of money and half the amount of time. She gave me her business card (which I left at the register) but quite frankly if I can't trust her with my brows I damn sure ain't going to trust her with my hair.  I guess I should mention that this review was not of the Ulta store itself which while usually understaffed is still a quiet, unintrusive shopping experience and they almost always have when I'm looking for. pardon any typos this review was written via voice to text while driving furiously away from the appointment like Cruella Deville at the end of 101 Dalmationsduring the car chase scene. i'm telling you guys I just don't know I don't know what went wrong.

I've been shopping at Ulta since I was a teen and have lived in 6 different states, but no Ulta has shown more integrity to me than this location. Long story short,  had a less than favorable trip to the Ulta salon a few weeks ago, but it wasn't because of the stylist, it was because of their pricing and (lack of) communication between myself and the salon as I went in for my appointment. The salon and my stylist stepped up and welcomed me back to remedy the situation. I was nervous because I was afraid I would be treated badly because of being a customer who ""complained"". 

My nerves were unwarranted. The salon manager Carry welcomed me in and listened to everything I had to say about my previous visit, and my stylist Sara and her both chatted with me about the miscommunication in my first visit and what could be done to fix it. I was blown away by their integrity and compassion towards me. And to top it off my hair was even better than I had hoped when I left. 

I am someone who likes to give my money to businesses that practice things I believe in like transparency and compassion, even when that business is a little more pricey than the next. The kindness, professionalism, and compassion shown towards me was the icing on the cake for me and my hair, which turned out better than I had wanted. I've already made my return appointment to Sarah and look forward to many more future visits after. I've been getting my hair professionally done since I was 13 years old, and it became a special part of my relationship with my mom and sister, and I will be recommending them to Ulta Salon.

1. I just got my septum pierced literally just a few days ago so it's still super sore. I went in looking for foundation initially and (obviously) got a few extras but anyway the lady that was helping me and did the foundation for me to see how it looked was super rough on me! Like I told her to please be gentle because my piercing was just done and she didn't even care and hit it a few time which really hurt. After I left I was actually bleeding from my nose where my piercing is because of it. 

2. I was JUST looking for foundation but the lady helping me threw 10 different products at me. Like I get that you're a salesperson but if I come in just looking for foundation why are you trying to get me to buy 2 primers, foundation, highlighter kit, contour kit, setting spray, exfoliator AND eye cream? It honestly made me feel stupid but I KNOW makeup and I just wanted to find a light weight foundation that matched my super pale skin tone  

3. It took ten minutes to get someone to help me by literally having stand in the same spot and stare at them until someone decided to help me. I saw multiple different employees but they ignored everyone around them including myself. 

4. I did find the foundation I needed/was looking for. So that's good. And the lady overall that helped me did get me what I was looking for which is good but I feel like it was a lot more work (and nose trauma) than necessary. 

The only saving grace was their tiny section of clearance where I got a bundle kit for 14  but I think the customer service here needs a lot of work. Overall it's a decent store.

After letting that sit and rinsing it out I went back to the chair for my cut, I asked for an aline bob. She took all of probably (generous estimate) 10 minutes giving me a blunt cut. She dried my hair and to my joy (sarcasm) my hair was red with a slight purple tint. She asked if I wanted layers around my face, she just held the hair framing my face and ran the scissors down both sides. I could've done that, I have done that.

The store is a fairly large size, so it can be overwhelming to navigate.  

I wandered around for a while looking for a few items. A few of the things I needed I found right away, but I was struggling to find a few other products. Even though the store was basically empty, it was hard to find a store rep.  When I did find somebody to ask them a few questions about an item, she wasn't very friendly or helpful. It seemed to be a chore to answer my questions and to have any interest in assisting me. It was a very unpleasant experience. 
The store ended up not having what I wanted, even though it was a common item and I'd seen it on Ulta's website as well. It's always frustrating and annoying when that is the case.   Sometimes I call a store first to see if they have a item in stock before I bother wasting my time and gas.   Of course I didn't do it this time, so that's just the way that goes.
I already had a few items in my hand and debated whether I just wanted to put them down and leave.  I decided to just rise above her unhelpful, unfriendly, poor, and pretentious attitude.    I looked around a little more, but felt overwhelmed by the fact that the store didn't have what I would consider a cohesively organized and logical layout.   I didn't think it was marked and/or lined out in an easy 'user friendly' fashion.  I decided to go ahead and check out shortly after that.  Thankfully the only friendly person in the store was at the register so that was refreshing. I'm not sure if I'll go back to Ulta.   Their prices were comparable to most prices I've seen elsewhere. Many of the things that I can get there I can get online as well if I wanted and really needed to. 
There is also Beauty Brands, which is closer to where I live as well.

I find that Ulta in general is usually a much quieter store than a Sephora or MAC. The employees let me browse at my own pace, which I adore but I'm sure is not for some people such as those needing guidance or consultation. I'm very into makeup and skincare and don't need or want much help ever. I hate ""hoverers"" or pushy employees, so it's definitely a perk for me to be left alone. 

One employee here is a total standout. His name is Kevin, and he's on the taller side and a bit lanky. He is A-MAZ-ING!! If you ever need help, ask for Kevin.

The ""stylist"" was currently highlighting someone else's hair. Just started. I was only getting a blowout and style for pictures. I waited until 11:40. Another girl came over and took me to wash my hair. She took literally 25 minutes just to wash it. Then to blow dry it another 30 minutes. Finally the stylist came over to curl my ends with the flatiron. She pinned them up and asked if I could just take them down when I got home. I told her no, I was paying her to style my hair. I left there at 1:30. 
The next time I went in, after scheduling an appointment for color weeks ahead of time. An hour before I arrived, we got the call that my stylist was leaving to go home and could I reschedule a month later. No. So they scheduled me with a first timer. Well, I get there, show the girl what I wanted, and she consults the girl I was supposed to have in the first place!  Then she walks out with her boyfriend!  Angry already. Then this girl does my color and it's nowhere near what I wanted!  I've had it done many times at a salon in Pittsburgh. Never had an issue. I also asked for layers for my cut. I got a light trim.

I arrived 10 mins early and was immediately taken which was a bonus.  She asked me what I wanted to do and I explained that I wanted all-over hair color to cover the grays (went into more detail regarding shade, etc), hair trim, and blow dry/style.  I waited while she mixed the color and watched her consult with who I assume was her manager (this made me a little nervous).  Let me tell you that this girl was S-L-O-W! It took her over an hour to apply color to my entire head (possibly 1.5) then she tells me ""Ok it has to stay on for 30 minutes"".  I said ""excuse me?"" (Cuz I've never had hair color stay on for that long especially when it took over an hour to apply). As I'm sitting there the salon is quickly emptying out so that by the time she says it's time to wash it out, there is not one customer there and only one other hairstylist who is also on her way out (its after 8 pm by now).  As I'm sitting in the shampoo chair she is washing my hair in the most gentle manner I've ever experienced and I'm thinking to myself ""How in the world is the hair color even washing out?"", not to mention how SLOWLY she's doing this too.  She FINALLY lets me up and I go over to the mirror knowing what I'm gonna find.  Firstly I notice my forehead is covered in dye then I run my hands through my hair and they come out covered in brown dye.  I turn to her and say, ""Um you didn't wash the dye out"" and show her my fingers.  Now I'm mad and I say ""I'm gonna wash my own hair"" and I proceed to do so while leaning over the sink scrubbing my scalp and hair (completely opposite of how she had done). As the water continues to run brown I ask her if this is supposed to happen and she replies that it's demi color so it's not permanent and is supposed to wash out some. Now I had no idea she hadn't put permanent dye in my hair so I'm even more pissed. I go over to the chair and she starts towel drying my hair ever so gently.  Then she starts combing it through and asks if I still want a haircut.  I answer no and she asks if I want t her to blow it out and again I tell her no.  As I'm getting up to leave I grab a towel since my hair is dripping wet.  I finish towel drying my hair and head to the register area.  I tell her I am supposed to get the promotional offer of 25% off, she applies it and I angrily storm off to pay (I regret paying anything now but there was no manager on sight at 8:30 pm anyway).

Always had my eyebrows done in nail salons until I started researching other options. I started going to an upbeat more expensive salon and then found this brow bar. My eyebrows started growing in the way I liked and were shaped the way I wanted. Yes $21 is a lot for eyebrows but it is truly NOT ENOUGH for how good they come out. Made the mistake of going to another ulta that was closer to me and within minutes all the time spent to grow my eyebrows out and get the shape I liked was thrown out. At this brow bar they will listen to what you like, talk to you about it and then draw on your eyebrows and show you exactly what they are going to do before they do it. It does not get any better than this. I do not care if I ever move millions of miles away, this brow bar is worth the price and the ride. Paying for good quality is not even a question when you could be paying the same price for CRAP, and trust me, I have.

Get this. She has the audacity to tell me I lied about how long I spent at the salon and how she checked it on camera. Are you kidding me? This is your response to a customer service issue? If that's the case, it should be clear on camera that I came in around 10 AM for my correction. You're employee came in after 10 AM, with a coffee, and I had to approach HER and ask her when we were going to begin. Also, I offered to come in on MY day off so your employee did not have to. I am an understanding client and I was happy to offer some flexibility there in hopes of a quality service that in the end was not provided.

Twenty minutes before the bride was to walk down the aisle, she received a voicemail from Ulta, stating that I (a bridesmaid) did not pay for (fake) eyelashes when I checked out of the salon. And that if Ulta did not receive the $6 by the next day, that the police would be called. 

Seriously? Such an extreme measure for the mistake of your makeup ""artist,"" who rang the ticket up and forgot to add the eyelashes into the charge for the eyelash application and makeup? As a bridesmaid, I had about a dozen other things to worry about and thought that upon receiving the ticket and paying in full, that I was cleared. 

Wrong, due to someone else's mistake. 

And even worse, calling the BRIDE as she's about to head down the aisle, to threaten her with the police? 

Get a life. Our tips to the makeup ""artist"" not only would have paid for the lashes, but were also much more than what she deserved. Even oompa loompas looked better than I did before I scrambled back to the hotel to redo my makeup. 

And shame on Ulta, for taking a very unprofessional and childish approach to getting your $6.

579,jefrGYC2ZlQjbZ6xztD3-g,qDHInkhNalPHQi8rYi9kjA,1.0,"I went in for an appointment a little over a week ago with an ""Elite"" stylist. I felt really confident we were on the same page. Before she ever touched my hair, we had a long conversation about what I wanted (I had booked a full highlight and a cut). I wanted to bring up the color of my 2-year-old ombre into a warm balayage, which was listed under the highlight service. She asked ""how blonde"", so I showed her a picture of the exact balayage I wanted. She said that had been ""exactly what she had in mind,"" and we talked about how nice it would be for fall. 

I said I wanted to take off 2-3 inches, with a max of 3 inches coming from the bottom, because the hair was pretty broken and dead. She said she could definitely do that and asked how I like to style my hair day-to-day. I said I love throwing it into a messy bun at home, curling it or straightening it for work, and sometimes just wearing it naturally curly by tossing it over one side of my head. I said I wanted layers cut back in because most had grown out. She had cut my hair before and it was nice, so there were no red flags. (Yet?)

Back to the color, she said how good long, choppy layers would look with the balayage I was going for. I had no reason to doubt that I wasn't going to get what I asked for--she went on and on about how good it was going to look once the color in my hair was refreshed.

When she took the foils out at the sink, she commented about how wonderfully my hair had lightened up. It hadn't been colored in nearly two years, so I knew it should've worked well since the dye was mostly on virgin hair. But then she said she wanted to make the color ""pop"" more, and would I be okay with her ""deepening the root"" with a little bit of dye? I trusted that she knew what she was doing, so I said it was fine. I thought maybe she had brought the balayage up a little too far and needed to touch it up to shadow the roots a bit. I stayed in the sink for another half hour while that dye set, and then we went back to the chair.

I was confused in the chair because even though my hair was wet, I couldn't see any signs of color. I thought I should've been able to see some of the warm blonde at the bottom, but there wasn't anything to be seen. It's okay, though, I thought, because I've colored my full head and barely been able to tell when it was wet. I'd wait until it was dry before making a judgment.

I didn't have any doubt about her ability to cut my hair, because I've been to her for a cut before. So when she came to the side and showed me where she intended to start cutting--about three inches from the bottom--I wasn't concerned. Until she was still trimming off bits from the bottom 20 minutes later, and I realized my hair had lost NEARLY SIX INCHES. I started to panic a little bit, but wanted to wait until she was finished. 

Maybe the layers would redeem it and it would be fine. Hair grows back, right? Maybe we'd had a miscommunication about the length? I didn't know it at the time ended up taking off all of my remaining ombre. I don't know how she interpreted ""I want to bring this color up since I'll lose some of it in the trim"" into ""take all of this color off."" But once she had dried my hair, I was shocked to see that not only had she taken SIX INCHES off, but it was also all one length. No layers to be seen. 

And the color? No slow, gradual transition from warm blonde to my natural dark brown. Just cool blonde highlights from top to bottom, throughout my entire head. And, as I later realized, the highlights aren't evenly spaced... and some have missing brown chunks where the brown dye was unevenly layered over the blonde during the shadow root touch-up.

I wondered if it was the salon lighting that was making me see things. I let her finish styling it, as she gushed about how it's ""still long"" even though it was barely touching my shoulders when it had formerly gone halfway down my back. I stupidly paid $$$ + tip for this absolute destruction of my hair.

Let's recap.

I asked for:
- a warm blonde balayage
- a maximum of 3"" cut off the length
- layers

I got:
- cool-toned root-to-tip highlights
- darker roots on formerly virgin hair, which will now be difficult to color over
- A minimum of SIX INCHES off of my hair, which will take over a year to grow back
- an all-one-length cut

Was it opposite day? Because I feel like I somehow came out on the other side of the cupboard in Narnia with a bad haircut.

The salon manager contacted me, offering to fix it, and told me if I couldn't get there in one to two weeks (I'm from out of town), she could give me 20% off my next service. I thought about going back, but ultimately decided it would be better to go somewhere else rather than risk it getting even worse. 

I asked Ulta for a partial refund for this nightmare, but haven't heard back. I'm not holding my breath.

584,RoWVC_rLZ85fFJrw6G8urg,qDHInkhNalPHQi8rYi9kjA,2.0,"Okay, so it's a chain store. But I've been to enough Ulta locations to know what separates one from another: the staff. Maybe the few times I've been here just all happen to coincide with an 'off' day for the employees, but it seems like there's only ever one person here at any given time who actually cares about not completely alienating potential customers. 

The last time I visited this location, I went with the intention of getting my eyebrows waxed. The seemingly lone salon employee said that she was busy with another client and wouldn't be able to assist me for at least 20 minutes. Okay, that's totally understandable. The (suspiciously empty) salon apparently had just one person staffing it, as it WAS in the late afternoon.

Imagine my surprise when I watched her leave the salon immediately after telling me she was busy. Imagine my further surprise when, upon exiting the store a few minutes later, I saw the same employee smoking and chatting away outside, looking like she had no intention of doing her job any time soon. 

The few minutes I spent browsing the store were quiet minutes, as not one store employee seemed interested in helping me find this item or notifying me of whatever current sale was going on. I spent one college summer working at another Ulta location and, let me tell you, we were told that satisfactory customer service was our top priority.

But I'd have to say it's their SERVICE that will keep me from returning ever again.  I'm not a huge consumer of these products, but maybe 2-3 times a year I'll drop a $100 each time.  About a year ago I received a % coupon from Sephora.  I had a few other errands to run in the same center as ULTA so I brought my Sephora coupon  along and asked if they'd honor the competitor coupon for the same products.  ""No-"" was their curt answer.  There was no offer or suggestion of maybe what they ""could"" do otherwise to earn my business. Just, ""No"" and a stare.   I left, and went to Sephora, who earned my money. Out of convience, I had other shopping to do in this same strip mall, once again.  I grabbed a cart and knocked off each errand along this outside mall while loading each purchase bag I made in the same cart (I know I was cart-double-dipping-lol!)  I also was carrying my 10 month old son in this cart as well (multi-tasking!)  I was ready to give ULTA another try.  As I was browsing the new fall nail colors, a somewhat stern blonde employee quickly approached me and asked me to please leave with my cart.  She explained that although she saw I was pushing an infant and was hauling other bags that their ""shelves were not designed nor sturdy enough in the event I pushed into one with my cart"".  Maybe if she had offered to hold my bags behind the counter, or helped me with my purchases while I used my hands to hold my son, I would have stayed.  But again, there was NO effort made to keep or earn my dollar.  There was no apology for the situation.  Not even a half-ass compassion attempt.  My happy little boy, wallet and I walked our butt out of ULTA for the very last time.

598,PdmRI-1GikEGse9E03lWjA,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,5.0,My review is based on my experience at the Benefit brow bar.  I had heard very positive reviews and results for Benefit's brow services although I had never tried them previously.  My brows were in need of some TLC and I researched where the closest Brow Bar was located.  Behold they have a location right down the road from me in Citrus Park.  I booked an appointment around lunch time today and they were able to fit me in this afternoon. My appointment was with Arlette.  She performed the brow mapping to help reshape my brows and make sure they were giving me the right shape for my face.  She was extremely friendly and took her time which put me right at ease.  Her knowledge of what eye brow shape would work on me and recommendations on their products that would work with my skin tone and hair color were very impressive.  The service and pricing is very reasonable and comparable to other waxing salons.  I will definitely be going back and may even try their brow tint service.,2015,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,7,1

I would say this was very much a similar experience just more convenient. I really don't feel like I know what is up with my skin, just I'm not happy. Chana asked me questions and had me fill out a card with info about my lifestyle... Suntanning, medications, etc. The typical things they ask you at spas before treatments. 

After that she got right to it. After cleaning and looking at my skin she suggested I try dermabrasion and since it was my first time I should start with the introductory service. I've always wanted to get dermabrasion but I have been thrown off by this price. This seemed reasonable so I was excited to try it out. I barely felt a thing as she was doing it. I would compare it to rubbing an eraser across my face. On top of that there was the entire facial with a mask and aromatherapy

619,Ah2Mp3qE2_fKHPugkkNCsA,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,1.0,"I have been going to Ulta for over 15 years. This is my hometown location where I have been getting my hair, facials, and eyebrows done since I was about 16 years old. I am now 32. My mother and I are loyal patrons, loyalty card holders, and repeat salon clients. I skip Aveda, and Sephora, as I have always preferred Ulta for their prices and quality of services. At this location, Donna did my hair for over 10 years, and since her departure from the store, I have entrusted my problematic locks to the talented Gina for about 2 years. I used to even wait until I would be in town from Miami to get my haircuts! 

Yesterday evening I was in the store shopping and saw that the brow bar was empty so I requested a wax service and was told they had immediate availability. I can honestly tell you that the associate's skill level was questionable (at best) from the beginning, although she was completely polite and professional. She put the wax on far too delicately for it to cover correctly. She also didn't use enough wax, and spent too long pressing it in. (by the time she actually pulled the strip off my face the wax was likely completely cool) I didn't say anything because I figured everyone has their approach and I am a brow bar loyalist (I trust that they are properly trained). She was well into applying concealer (incorrectly) when I myself reached for the hand mirror, since she had not offered to show me my brows at all, post-waxing. I was mortified. Not a single hair that I walked into the store with that evening was missing. It looked only like someone had made my brows red, not that I had had a wax. I showed her the many, many hairs that she missed and she reapplied wax and tried again. Again, too little wax, pressing too light and for too long, and the hairs remained. I pointed it out to her, and she said she would get her manager. That took an easy 15 minutes so I just sat there with the exact same eyebrow growth I had when I walked in. Frankly I didn't know what else to say to the associate. She clearly didn't know what she was doing, and I didn't want to risk any skin over this by allowing her to apply a THIRD attempt. It was awkward, as these encounters can be, but she really was sweet and I think she expected the manager to handle things appropriately. 

The manager, Lynn, came over and told me that the hairs were too short for the wax to ""catch"". I've never heard such a dismissive load of BS in my life. I have had my eyebrows waxed maybe 100 times in my life. At this Ulta location, several in south Florida, and plenty of private salons and spas. The hairs were not ""too short."" That is an outrageous thing to claim. A good wax job should get ALL hairs; long, medium, short, baby, and fuzz. I have gone in to that EXACT location with LESS brow growth and come out with clean, hairless brows. She kept repeating that I could just have the associate ""pluck them."" EXCUSE ME? Um...I can pluck my own eyebrows at home, and believe me, do a better job with tweezers than this associate. I came for a WAX. I was being charged for a WAX. The associate mentioned to me twice that she was new, and apologized, and frankly I don't hold her ultimately responsible. She does need better training, but the decision to charge me all but 20% of my service was left to the unprofessional manager who just lost a lifetime Ulta customer over a pitiful $15. 

I spent over $130 on products yesterday, and a fortune over the years. I even brought my bridal party to this location on my wedding day for our hair services. BOTH cashiers at checkout 100% agreed with me that my brows absolutely were not waxed correctly and they both extended their condolences. They had no choice but to charge me what the manager instructed. I was ultimately charged $15 for my $21 service and not only are my brows WORSE  than they were before walking into Ulta, (since now I'll have to wait a few days to get them waxed correctly) but I am completely turned off from this brand. Every gal knows you can walk into any corner nail salon and get a decent brow wax for about $8. I chose to pay the Ulta premium because it has always been my experience that their brow bar associates are suedo-experts in the trade and the Ulta brand takes care of its clients. I have requested to be reimbursed by corporate, but this taste in my mouth will be difficult to overcome. The economic temperature in America right now is not such that business owners and managers should take the liberty to make clients feel so devalued. I live in Channelside and drove across town to get to my favorite little beauty store in Citrus Park. When someone is making that kind of effort, and spending this kind of money, you only have to disappoint them once.

Before I went here yesterday, I signed up for their rewards club. Get 1 point for every $1 spent. Spend $450/yr get 1.25 points for every $1 spent + you get some free gifts. When you make returns, the points earned on those products are deducted from your rewards balance. I made my return on four items today and had no problem at all. Great return policy: you can't have used more than 25% of the product and it has to be within 60 days of purchase.

I feel like one of this store's biggest problems is that whenever I'm looking for a specific color, they always seem to be out of it.  It makes me think the person responsible for ordering does not check the stock on a frequent enough basis.

I will say that during my most recent visit, when they were out of a color I wanted, a store representative made the excellent suggestion to get the particular shade I wanted in an eye shadow version, as it could be used as an eye liner (which they were out of), and she was 100% correct.  I never would have known had she not stepped up, so I really appreciate it.

Check out was very speedy my most recent visit, and of course, I love getting a free sample with checkout!",2016,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,11,1

Not one person -Brooke (who I have no idea who or what she looks like) or the receptionist came up to me and let me know the reason for my wait or apologized for the delay.  I went back up to the receptionist again and asked her how much longer.  She said she would ask Brooke. Finally at about 6:10 pm I left the salon. They did call me as I was walking to my car.  I called the next morning and spoke with a gentleman who said-You left and they called you.  I explained I waited for over 40 minutes and know one came up to me and explained or apologized for the delay.  He then told me the manager of the salon would call me.  Well this never happened.

I had EXCELLENT service with both Face and Hair!

Christine was amazing and made me feel at ease - explaining all the procedures - step by step whilst doing a very professional Facial with Microdermabrasion.
My skin looked fantastic afterwards and I have decided to have another one in 02 weeks time.
I can highly recommend Christine. What a wonderful Beautician!

I then had my hair done with Max.  
Max is very gentle with hair -- and colored, treated  and blow dried my hair exactly the way I wanted it to be done. What a pleasure to not have a Stylist that treats hair in a nice fashion... Max is very friendly and does an excellent job!
Next time I visit I might just do some highlights too!
My hair felt great! 

Everyone was so friendly and helpful in the Store: LOTS of positive energy!

The Store is very clean and organized: slightly congested as they display a lot of stock - but  overall really a LOT of FUN to browse and Shop!

The checkout counter isn't in the middle of the store anymore, so the line is a bit more orderly like at other Ulta locations. It's only a 3 min drive for me, so when I need makeup, perfume or hair care items, this is my go-to place. 

I can't say I've had the best service here or the worst. It's standard for what it is. Sephora or the Mac counter at dept stores give a much better makeup advice, but Ulta has a bigger variety of everything beauty, so I can do a lot of shopping here at once. The Ulta private label brand isn't bad either...I at least like their lip glosses.

I must say I will never get my eyebrows threaded there again. The dude did a horrible job that I had to live with for 2  1/2 weeks.

It gets really busy in this store around the holidays, so there are a lot of items that I can find at the newer Clearwater location that I can't find here.

I do wish there were a Benefit counter here...I loved the way they fixed my eyebrows in New York. 

I can't review any other salon services, but I will say that I'm afraid to use them...seems too commercial with turnover.",2014,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,12,0

634,bAmK1OzZpDkKeN_az63sMw,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,2.0,"The only thing that keeps me going back to Ulta's is that it has a benefit brow bar inside. However, over the past few years, I've noticed that the benefit brow bar experience tends to always be better when they're inside a Macy's or department store than an Ulta Beauty. 

This particular Ulta is right by my house, which is the only reason why I've given this place a try. I've tried to call and set up a brow bar appointment no less than at least 10 times and have never been able to successfully reach someone at the brow bar to set a time. Finally, I just gave up trying to call and showed up to try and get a walk in appointment at the brow bar.

I walked in, no one greeted me, and then I stood and waited at the brow bar while they were finishing their service for about 10-15 minutes, and then someone walked up before me while I was standing there and cut in for a service, and was then ""put in line"" before me. I then promptly approached the brow bar and let them know that I had been waiting for them for the past 10-15 minutes for them to finish up before approaching them, even though it was obvious that they had noticed I was waiting the entire time, and still said that I would have to wait until after the next person who just walked up. It was absolutely infuriating. They mentioned that I should have made an appointment, to which I let them, I've tried relentlessly, but had never been able to reach the brow bar, and had been on hold for 15 minutes at a time before I just gave up and took my business elsewhere. The associate at the brow bar wasn't the most friendly and was sick as well. 

When checking out, the associate asked if I wanted to use anyone else's Ulta membership when checking out, even though I know it's store policy as well to use other peoples reward accounts because it's supposed treated like ""using someone else's credit card"". 

While this store is one of the larger ones that I've been to with more high end options like MAC and so forth, the customer service is just abismal and I will continue to take my business and brow needs to a different benefit brow bar elsewhere.",2018,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,3,0
635,q3REJnRgidfOushLTm83Kw,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,4.0,"This is my local Ulta, and while I don't pop in here all the time, it's my go-to for my shampoo and conditioner (especially when they send me a coupon in the mail). 

The store is pretty cramped but easy enough to navigate. The salon is toward the back left and is always booming with customers. Everyone in there seems to be having a good time. The floor associates are always courteous and quick to ask if I need any help. And I mean really quick. I know exactly where my shampoo is, make a beeline for it, then pull a sick 180 toward the cash register. And they still manage to get a word in.

The registers are my only problem with the store. Think of a HomeGoods or Marshall's line of registers without the defined queue. This results in customers who, shall we say, think less intuitively about queue flow, and force the line down actual store aisles instead of snaking it around where it should go. This could be easily solved by adding a roped-off section specifically for the queue. The store is so packed full of end caps and shelves anyway, that removing something toward the registers would solve two problems at once.

While I don't go to this store more than about twice a year, it's not an experience I dread. They always have what I'm looking for, and they deliver coupons semi-frequently. Not a bad place to physically shop for beauty products in Citrus Park at all.

As a side-note, one irking thing about Ulta in general is that they press you for your phone number more than any other business I've been to. They say it's for returns, but they can be very aggressive about it. I just give them my mom's phone number (which they already have), and she gets the points, just so I can avoid the minor confrontation.",2019,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,7,1

The girls are really nice and willing to offer help if needed, though unfortunately I feel like some of them are not fully trained. Love that I can get both drugstore and higher quality cosmetics in one place, it saves me having to make the trip to both CVS and Sephora in one day.

I went in today to get a new foundation and a few other things, and the one thing that really stood out to me(making this 2 stars) was that there were soooo many messy and gross displays. There were at least 5 items I wanted to purchase but they were down to the last item with the package broken open and obviously used. When I got home I opened up one of the things I got(a box containing a few different goodies) and one of the products inside had been obviously used. Really? Never happened at Sephora or even at Target, CVS, etc. Thankfully it was just a powder so I can scratch off the top layer and sanitize it with alcohol, but I'll never buy anything that isn't SEALED from them again. Sometimes at Sephora I feel like the girls are hovering over me or following me, maybe the girls at Ulta need to get it together and start doing that so people stop being gross with their products. Catch them in the act and tell them to stop, seriously. I'd rather be followed around than be unable to buy products because they're used. The store is pretty big and I just really don't think they have enough people walking the floor.

Also today a man(maybe the owner?) was going around screaming about the renovations and complaining about people swatching nail polishes on the displays.

My 2 biggest complaints is I would say a good 80 percent of the time I find their stock to be very low.  Especially anything that is new or has a lot of buzz around it.  I would have to guess that this has to be the buyer is not ordering enough product to meet the demand.  But it isn't just high demand products, many items have very low stock as well. I expect this to happen from time to time, especially with a new store, but this a habitual issue. 
  The other issue I have is the last time I went in there were a lot of promotional displays that were blocking pathways and this was made worse by three female employees congregating right in the middle of the walk path to the registers and exit while they laughed and joked, completely obvious to anyone else around them.  Too many promotional displays really start to create congestion and deminish the shopping experience.",2018,NV,Nevada,43.6260062,-116.35162903,Y,7,0

The 4 stars are for this store being well stocked, clean and having a fabulous selection of merchandise. 
On to the tea...
OK I'm not sure what happened today at this Ulta. I was doing my usual rounds, taking pics of products for my IG, testing new items and grabbing my must haves. I've been in the beauty industry for over a decade so nothing really shocks me anymore, I even own a small indie brand StinaFace (find me on IG @stinaface, bet you liked that little plug right) So I am definitely familiar with the retail sector of the industry. Anyway today I was waiting in line to make a purchase, my hubby walked in with my 1 year old son and they walked over to me to stand with me while I waited in line. Thats when it all started... 
I heard a loud voice yell from about 15 feet away ""YOU READY?!"" It was the cashier closest to the entrance. I politely said yes and walked over. At first I just assumed maybe I wasn't paying attention, or maybe I didn't hear her the first time even tho I was actually In a hurry to get rung up because my little family and I were headed for the corn maze. When I reached the register The cashier didn't greet me, she said in a very stern manner ""do you have a phone number on file?"".... that's when I knew whatever this attitude was, it was directed intentionally towards me. I said yes and gave her my number. I also had a digital coupon on my phone, she saw it and scanned it and gave me a pretty annoyed look. She handed me my bag and that was it.... but man this girl threw so much bad energy my way I felt like I needed to run home, burn some sage, pray to Jesus, take a spiritual bath just to get whatever she threw on me off. Even my husband was like ""what was that about"" ... Maybe I'll never know..
it was some twilight zone stuff for sure.",2018,NV,Nevada,43.6260062,-116.35162903,Y,10,0

I baby wear my baby and don't have anyone to watch her. I went in to the Ulta salon and Stephanie had no problems cutting my hair standing up while I wore my baby. She even interacted with my baby. To all the mothers out there you know just how much this means to a mother. My hair looks so much better and I was able to get it done with my baby and all. Thank you so much Stephanie!

I stated what I needed and then a beautiful (and I cannot emphasize this fact enough) boy helped me not only find what I needed, but got me signed up with an account and helped me get product they were sold out of even delivered to my door.

1. To get my free birthday gift
2. To try out the It Cosmetics brand. 
I browsed around the store looking at all the make up goodies & scoped  out the girl who had the best makeup application on herself. I found Rachael.  I explained to her that my skin has become totally strange since moving to Idaho 8 months ago. I told her that I was interested in the It line, but I was also open to other brands. We discussed what I needed as far as coverage as well as the overall condition of my skin.  She told me that It would be a good brand for me.  She asked if I wanted her to apply some to see how it looked & I happily accepted. She used minimal amounts of the make up & made my skin look gorgeous in less than 10 minutes.  She answered ALL of my questions without a hint of attitude. She was very knowledgeable of all of the product lines & I appreciated that a lot! 
After she finished applying the makeup I looked in the mirror and was floored! It looked great!  She didn't use a ton of product & she explained everything she was doing as she applied it.  I'm pretty confident that I will be able to replicate what she did. I love how my skin looks and feels. 
This is truly a great Ulta location! If you haven't been here before , I highly recommend going out & checking It out.  I also recommend asking if Rachael is available to help you out.",2017,NV,Nevada,43.6260062,-116.35162903,Y,5,1

668,M5BnrbRCxk2RSRywjhgJdg,6ZdgPekv8DEvwLmh66wJIQ,5.0,"Surprisingly,  this was my FIRST time an Ulta store! The bright lights against the white monochrome decor had me hypnotized as I wandered through aisle after aisle of beautiful makeup and skincare products. I wanted it all! Luckily, I had visited the Ulta website earlier in the day and came across an amazing Free Gift with Purchase offer with $88 that actually had some really great stuff in it, and in colors I will actually use!!
I wenr in at 8:40pm, and although the store closes at 9pm, I didn't get any sort of attitude from any of the 3 employees that said Hi to me and all very politely and professionally asked if I needed help finding anything.  At first I was fine and didn't need help. Right up front I spotted the Ulta Brand and laid eyes upon the gorgeous warm toned neutral palette by Miss Fabulous, a YouTube beauty blogger that made this particular palette as a collaboration with Ulta! I grabbed that and one of their Ulta Brand Automatic Lip Liners in ""Rose"", which is an awesome rose pink that I would consider ""nude"" and can be used as a liner with many different lip product shades. The eyeshadow pallete was $20 and the liner was $8. Fair prices for the Ulta Brand. 
I love that there are an abundance of testers out!!
I suddenly remembered that I have been wanting to get a Beauty Blender! Yes, the little pink secret weapon of girls, boys, and Drag Queens everywhere!  I asked the very sweet girl behind the back counter, I think it was a makeover/spa counter of some sort, if she could just point me in the direction of the Beauty Blenders! I would have been cool with her literally pointing in the direction or even just telling me the aisle number! But this top notch Ulta employee WALKED ME ALL THE WAY OVER TO IT! And it was on the opposite side of the store from us, too! 
Unfortunately,  Ulta does NOT carry the original, actual Beauty Blender brand of makeup sponge. However, being a ""Girl-in-the-Know"", I was aware that the ""Real Techniques"" sponge is the closest dupe and that's just what they had! The Real Techniques are $10.99 for TWO blenders, unlike the original Beauty Blender, which is $20 for ONE! Also, the RT blender has a FLAT side, which seems like it would press that foundation in Tony our skin better, and it has a sharper point at the top for really getting that concealer right up against your under eye area! I've yet to try the RT sponge, but let me know if anyone reading this wants an ""update"" as to how the RT makeup blending sponge or anything I purchased worked out!
So, I qualified for their FGWP and received a cute little makeup bag with $88 worth of Ulta Brand Makeup in it for FREE!! And it's in colors that I will actaully use! I can list what was in the bag in an ""update"", too.!
I was so excited and overwhelmed by my shopping experience that I completely forgot to use the $3.50 Off purchase of Ulta Brand worth $21 Or More that I had printed off from the Ulta website earlier in the day. 
Thr girl at the register looked up my ""Ultimate Rewards"" card info by my phone number as it wasn't pulling up on my cell phone. You get One Point for every $1 you spend, PRETAX!!! 100 points is worth $3.00. That's a pretty generous rewards system! She was also very nice and helpful and I enjoyed chatting with her while she rang me up. She was even nice enough to show me a whole chart that shows the scale of your Rewards and what they are with dollar amount wise. I wish I would have asked and/or remembered all of their names!! Since I came in 20 minutes before closing, I really did expect to be treated with a sour attitude and not receive any help. I am beyond satisfied and impressed with how each employee treated me and when they found out it was my first time in an Ulta, they were even excited for me, joked around with me, and we briefly discussed our mutual love of all things makeup!  What a great staff at this location!
I will definitely be returning to this particular Ulta to make future makeup and skincare purchases for the foreseeable future!! 
I highly suggest that before going into the store,  take some time and look over the Ulta website and check out their sales,  new arrivals, and special offers and FGWP!! I wouldn't have known about the free bag of stuff if I hadn't visited the website!  And, USE YOUR REWARDS CARD!!! Earn points and benefit from buying higher end makeup, it all adds up very quickly! 
I am super stoked I FINALLY stepped foot into one of the two Makeup Meccas! 
We will see if the other store can even hold a candle to the wonderful employees here! I will most definitely be calling the store later and informing the Manager of my positive experience here!

May your eyeshadow not fade, may your concealer never crease, and may your eyebrows always be on Fleek! 

I highly recommend shopping this Ulta location my fellow Makeup Addicts!!

In this case it was hair.  I had just moved up from LA and had been in town for only three weeks.  I had a second interview coming up with a high profile tech company and my fine, curly hair was looking pretty ragged.

My last hair dresser, who I had been going to for around 10 years has hair that is similar to my own, so she got me.  Plus, she became a good friend.  She had also styled industry people on set at the Golden Globes, cut hair for actors/models, but mostly high level celebrity's assistants/attorneys/publicists.  My point: she is amazing.

Back to my situation- I didn't have much time.  My mom's hair always looks nice and she has a great head of hair (no extensions) for being a senior.  I chose to go to her hair dresser, Raquel.

It turns out Raquel has thick, wavy/curly hair too.  She is great at what she does!  She touched up my roots, did a conditioning thing and a blowdry.  I got 3 compliments before I even paid my bill!  I loved that she trimmed my ends just the tiniest bit, as I like to keep my hair long.

I'm not taking off a full star, but more a quarter: we were both feeling kind of tired and stressed, so the energy was a little low.  Next time, I'll make sure I have caffeine with me.

I've never been in the store, never had my hair done by a beautician, but I'm a wedding photographer and in the course of my work, I've met and photographed a lotta beauticians as they're doing a bride's hair and that's how I met Leslie, as she was doing Brandy's hair on her wedding day.

As well as finding the perfect look for my wedding last year. The service here is beyond top notch. Now when I travel back east I have to quadruple check that I have what I need before I leave.

I also received a FREE can of SexyHair texturizing hair spray! It seems to be either a Travel Size or Deluxe Sample Size. It's a pretty darn good size for being free and I didn't even know I was gonna get it! Cool!!!
I was alone, so I really took my time looking around at all of the pretty makeup. It's like Heaven for me. As I walked around, every now and then an employee would very kindly asked me if I needed help, and while about 3 employees asked me this, I never felt pressured or bothered. In fact, I engaged in quite a few pleasant conversations about makeup and skincare with each person and it was nice to talk to people that share the same level of passion and love for makeup and all things beauty that I do!
One employee, I didn't get her name, a very nice and gorgeous older woman that seemed to be designated to the Too Faced/Urban Decay area even went to the other side of the store to see if Soap & Glory had any of their cosmetics In Store yet, and while she didn't see that there was in fact a small shipper display of about 15 products, she was still very, very helpful and we actually talked for 10 minutes about how awesome Clinique is! I'm a nerd, I know. I didn't get upset that this lady didn't see the Soap & Glory display as it was tucked into a weird place about 3 rows into the HAIRCARE section!  Lol
I ended up getting the Makeup Revolution Neutrals vs New-trals eyeshadow palette for $8.00 after my 20% off coupon, and it's GORGEOUS! There were also a bunch of, and Im talkimg about 90% of the display, of Palladio that was on Clearance right now! I only paid $3.50 for a Velvet Matte Lip Cream, $1.50 for a Lip Liner, and only $2 for a Felt Tip Brown Liquid Eyeliner! I estimate that I saved Iaround $15 to $20! I was bummed that I wasn't able to apply the 20%off coupon to the  $18 Clinique Lip Gloss I was getting.  Sounds like a lot for one lip gloss, but it's in ""Black Honey"" which is a Cult Classic in the beauty world! 
I was surprised at the lack of Holiday Sets, especially from Too Faced! They are known for their Holiday sets, and only a few of the smaller ones were in the store! I fully expected to see the whole kit-n-kaboodle on display. Maybe it will all be out on display closer to Christmas? 
I love that I earn 1 Point for each dollar I spend,  pretax. I have over 100 points right now and could have redeemed it for $3 towards my purchase, but I want to save up a whole bunch and put it towards a higher end eyeshadow palette.  
I love Ulta. I love this store and yet again, every single staff member I came in contact with was pleasant and professional! I enjoy coming to THIS location very much.
I think the Ulta on South Virginia might be a little bigger, but I'm willing to sacrifice selection for great customer service. I've heard that the employees at that the S. Virginia location aren't as nice and helpful. And ya know what? I can ways order stuff online. 
The cost of makeup adds up fast and some of it is very expensive, I'm talking $50 for ONE eyeshadow palette!
But, makeup is my love, my obsession, and the most fun and beautiful way in the world that I can express myself and create art and beauty on my face each day!
I'm really glad that I am able to interact with such lovely people in the staff at the Spanish Springs Ulta! Even if it's a bit longer of a drive for you, I highly recommend that you come to this location as I assure you that the staff will help you with anything you need, they are all awesome, and it's always an enjoyable and pleasant experience! 
Thank you to the staff here!  I will be back again soon!

715,0OnqSvyblod55eNNmnn4BQ,6ZdgPekv8DEvwLmh66wJIQ,4.0,"This review is for the Benefit Brow Bar located within this Ulta.

My method of eyebrow grooming for years was threading. I have pretty sensitive skin so I transitioned from plucking them myself straight to threading, skipping waxing as I've always heard it can wreck a havoc on your skin if it's sensitive. Unfortunately for me, any method of eyebrow grooming tends to be a very painful experience for me. As much as I love the final product, I have definitely left some salons red-eyed with tears streaming down my face due to the sheer pain that threading puts me through.

I then moved to Reno and couldn't find a good threading place to go to. I had heard talk about the Brow Bar and how they work wonders on your eyebrows, but I was always hesitant to go since they wax. They also provide a plucking service if you are not into waxing, but plucking is just as painful as threading for me - if not more!

So I sucked it up and went to the closest place near me with a Brow Bar, and it was the Ulta in Sparks. I have since had a second appointment and I can say that I much, much, MUCH prefer the Brow Bar to threading. This is my first foray into waxing so I can't compare how other estheticians may wax, but all pulling the strip off does is make me flinch a little, and that's about it. Compared to how I death-grip the chair and cry for the duration that a cotton string is pulling rows of hair out of my face, the wax is nice and warm, and doesn't hurt at all when pulled off.

Both times my eyebrows were done by Mercedes - it seems she is the only one working the Brow Bar at this location? - but she is amazing, super friendly, and really easy to hold a conversation with. I don't normally like talking when I'm at a salon but she is great. She also will put makeup on at the end to fill in your eyebrows if needed/cover up any redness. My skin so far has not reacted at all to the wax, which is super awesome on my end, and lets me keep coming back every 6-8 weeks to get my eyebrows done. It is $20 a pop, which is more than what I paid to have my eyebrows threaded, but I think the comfort level (for me) is worth paying extra.",2012,DE,Delaware,39.5811881345,-119.7406767411,Y,11,1

They helped provide a very enriching and relaxing experience. They had H20 Plus
Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Butter. We loved the Shampoo and my wife assured me that although I don't condition my hair often my scalp would thank me and my hair would feel and look better if I tried it and she was so right.. 
The body butter was amazing and we agreed we wanted to get these products to use at home.

We had no idea how difficult it would be to find these 'Spa' grade products that are apparently provided on many luxury cruise ships.
We found on the H20 Plus website that ULTA was supposed to carry the H20 Plus line and headed over to see if we could find the ones we had gotten at the Inn we stayed at.

We were overwhelmed upon arrival at all they had to offer, (and guys it's much more 'a woman's store but that doesn't mean they don't have products for us to use as well). Unfortunately we could not find the H20 Plus Shampoo or Conditioner but they did carry the H20 Plus Body Butter (at $25 for an 8oz tube it's a bit spendy but worth it).

We were a bit disappointed that they didn't carry the Shampoo but at least we found the Body Butter.

The staff were friendly enough- but seemed a bit aloof.

We hope they start carrying the rest of the H20 Plus line so that we don't need to order on-line which is the only way we were able to get the Shampoo/Conditioner.

We would definitely go back for these products for the convenience. But as it stands the price for the Body Butter is the same on-line at Amazon or at the H20 Plus website so we may as well just purchase all three products on-line.",2014,DE,Delaware,39.5811881345,-119.7406767411,Y,3,1

Usually when I am shopping here I am shopping for my daughter. You are greeted when you arrive. If you need help there is almost always somebody who can assist you. Unless you are there around Christmas time then this place can be a zoo.

When anyone offers to help you they will ask what price range of product are you looking for. I think that is awesome!! My daughter and I both have allergies so we shop for hypo allergenic. Also if something doesn't work for just bring back the remainder of the product and get a refund. I have had to do this on one or two occasions and have never had a problem.

Close to my house, no pushy sales reps, Mercedes in the Browbar is great, and I never have a problem with the products i need not being in stock.

Although, I will be honest , most of my review is towards Mercedes in the Benefit BrowBar.

I have never done my brows before nor waxed them . So I was pretty nervous about coming down.
I also knew there was places that were cheaper to get them waxed but at the same time I heard stories about people making their eyebrows too thin.

I finally gave it a shot and made a appointment with Mercedes. Came in and I let her know this was my first time for my brows in general and she was completely amazing from beginning to end. She described the procedure to me and the side effects I might get after then when it finally came to the waxing , she made sure I was relaxed and comfortable before starting to wax.

At the end of everything she taught me how to fill in my brows and how to shape them and helped me pick the right color for my brows. I was very pleased with the service and at the end didn't mind spending the extra money just because it was worth the experience.

A few months later , I came back to her and same exact perfect Customer Service from Mercedes, and to top it off she gave me a little test benefit browmade to try out.

Highly recommend for first timers who never done their brows or need a little help with their brows. Mercedes won't let you down and totally worth it all at the end!",2017,DE,Delaware,39.5811881345,-119.7406767411,Y,9,1

Carly's schedule was already booked with a large wedding party in the morning-so we already had a good vibe knowing that she was highly requested! We set up a trial makeup run after securing the actual date (always a good idea) and a 10 minute facial before the actual big day. She created the perfect look mirrored after a picture our daughter brought in and was absolutely calming when it came to the high demand for ""cat eyes on fleek"" and ""shimmering"" eye shadow. By the end of both sessions, Carly was more of a friend than just an employee doing her job. She is personable, knowledgeable, and good at what she does.

So whatever your fancy, chances are they might have it. They carry anything from make-ups to perfumes, hair products and random beauty accessories! It really can be a one-stop shop for a woman or man concerned with their personal grooming.

The thing I probably like to oogle at when I come here are the shelves of travel-sized products.  They are a great way to try something new and different without committing yourself to a product you might hate.   And if you do end up loving it, you can always come back and buy a bigger one!

Customer service is almost non-existent unfortunately. I've been here multiple times and no greetings when I come in during all of my visits. Yes, there were associates standing around by the door conversing amongst themselves.  I once came in and looked around for a new foundation to try back when I was in-between foundation brands and got no help from anyone so I ended up going to Sephora instead.

I usually just come here for the brow wiz or some lip or hair item. I am more of just an in and out customer now and if I need help with something or shopping for a not so specific item where I might need to consult someone, I know not to come here.

Overall, this store is clean and organized and do carry a variety of beauty necessities.",2017,FL,Florida,38.628082642,-90.3413295216,Y,1,0

Anyway, this time and the last three times I have been there, its been impossible to get help when I needed it. There have been gaggles of girls sitting at the front counter laughing and ignoring anything else in the store or looking out the window because their friends are messing around outside. During these purchases, I was rang up through all of this and then my bag was handed to me without so much as a goodbye. Super rude. Last time I was there without needing help, I was asked if I needed help, I said no thanks, and the girl sat there staring at me like I had kicked her dog. She then turned around and walked off without another word. Today was the last straw. I went in looking for concealer. I asked the nearest staff for recommendations. I asked between two brands, she said the other. She was behind me then, so I asked her how I could figure out the best shade between two. She goes, ""um...you swatch it."" And walked off. My hands are full, I'm looking for a little direction, and it was not worth any time to her. I ended up having to ask the cashier which looked best after bringing them both up because she couldn't be bothered.

810,v0ukNtkeHk_KtPSKOT_lSA,qPohxPukFHiTsQ5wFQa0FQ,1.0,"This is for the salon service I received on Feb 2. I am pretty disappointed with how my experience went down.

I arrived 6 minutes later from my scheduled appointment so my apologies for that. All the stylists were busy with someone including the person that I had booked my appointment with. Of course that was no biggie. That's how it can get in a salon and I was late for my appointment so simply I just had to wait. There's a chair available to sit right next to the counter so that's where I settled. Several ladies asked me if I needed help or if I've been helped and I told them that I have an appointment with .... at 2 so I'm just waiting for her to finish. I waited an hour until she finished with her client and that didn't even bother me at all.. the one thing that put the icing on the cake for this whole thing was that by the time my stylist was finished and I am still sitting on the same chair I hear her coming and as she's printing out the receipt with her client as she's with another stylist at the computer, the other lady tells my stylist ""this person never showed up"" and my stylist says ""ohh really? Well that's fine just cancel her. She was a kind of a weird one anyway. Let's get so and so set up for her next appointment."" Right then and there I wanted to get up and leave. I couldn't believe what I just heard... I guess they did not even know I was sitting right there. After several seconds the other stylist asks me ""are you antoinette?"" And I turned to her and said yes. Both of the ladies gasp and my stylist looks at me and says ""no way! Everyone was telling me that they you never showed up. It's ok I can take you right now."" I told them both ""I don't know why they would tell you that because several lady's came up to me and asked me what I was here for and I've been sitting here since 2 and even advised I was a bit late"" I wanted to tell her off and say that I don't know why you would still take me in anyway to do service if you just called me weird. My birthday is the next day and I really wanted to get my hair done because it's been way overdue and I was in a good mood so I just went in to get it done. Mind you I've seen this stylist before who cut my sons hair on Christmas Eve which I was so grateful for because all salons were closing early and she happened to be one that would wait out for me and that was still in to help anyone when I was calling around. we had a really good conversation and I felt like I clicked with her to be comfortable so I definitely wanted to come back and even recommend her. I still get my service done and she did an ok job. We still talked away a storm of conversation but I didn't forget what happened. I was just trying not to let it get to me because I am nice person and I didn't feel like causing a scene and I am a better person to step down to that level.

Can't be wrong, I am a weird person, but being unaware or being unprofessional at your work, no matter what you think of someone I'd be careful with what you have to say and keep opinions outside of the work area. I would point out the name of this stylist, but I choose not to because the salon itself is just terrible with communication and it's service so this review is not just for her, but for everyone. I just don't get when you have several ladies ask you if you need any help and then later they tell the other ladies that someone didn't show up when the person is waiting and then gets called by the stylist you are seeing that you're a weird one and basically saying that you're not liked and they don't even know you're around.

Then a toner to get it all looking cohesive. 
So, all over blonde on my roots but instead of going all the way to the scalp, just use the brush to feather it in so when it grows out a little it won't look too bad. Sounds simple enough. Except Cici was extremely confused. She kept saying she could do highlights but that isn't what I wanted. Then she said she was going to get the manager so I waited for her to finish her other appointment. While we were waiting, she said that she didn't feel confident enough to be able to do my hair and maybe someone else should do it. So that wasn't comforting at all. 
Then the manager came over and told me that what I was asking for was difficult and kept suggesting highlights and partial highlights and a balayage.

HUNDREDS of dollars in services and products to reverse the damage done by the bleach this man applied THREE TIMES in one sitting, a service that took FIVE HOURS of my time.

Then she says, ""Oh yea, I tried to see if we had any when you bought it, but didn't see any, so that's why I didn't give it to you."" Ok, this makes it even worse, so you knew that my purchase should have included the gift and instead of saying, ""I am sorry we are out,"" or making the excuse, ""We just ran out.""

I've been steered well by the same employee multiple times, as to which products to buy and which to avoid.  She'll tell me honestly which are not worth purchasing!  Very thankful for that.

It seems Ulta now offers some high end brands these days, such as Lorac, Stila, Two Faced.

This place recently opened and I had to see what my friends were raving about.

Wow. Just about everything health and beauty related can be had in one location.

Off the top of my head, they have: makeup and accessories, nail polish/gel (and lamps), hair brushes/combs, stuff for your brows, bleaching, hair removers, nail clippers, hair dryers, shampoos, conditioners, other hair products, lipstick, etc. Basically, almost anything you can find in a drugstore or average beauty salon can be found here. And more.

They have Ulta brands (there were a few $2/$4 sales going on when I was in) and Sally Hansen and many major brands. 

Because I think certain companies want all of their products in their own dedicated aisle, you may have to search around for items such as lipsticks and nail polish, whether they are all in the same aisle, or in their own major brand aisle.

I think (but I'm not sure) that they even had beauty consultants to help you choose makeup by applying them on you.

If you're into someone greeting you, they definitely have this one attentive woman who made a point of greeting everyone that comes in.

Note: I don't usually buy high-end products, so I don't know if those are carried here. And if you're loyal to certain brands at department stores, they may not have them here. This really is a one-stop place for your day-to-day beauty needs.",2013,FL,Florida,36.1096395843,-86.7648176939,Y,9,1

I hadn't had a cut in about six months, thanks to a traumatizing haircut earlier in the year. However, I let Heather cut off two inches- first she took a baby-step of cutting off a quarter-inch, and then I let her cut off the rest. She's a stylist you can trust not to go crazy cutting off all your long hair, which I appreciate. 

She did a wonderful job with my color, and was a relaxing and interesting person to talk to. I'm so glad they opened this salon; we needed something in this area. 

The variety of high-end cosmetics next to drugstore cosmetics is so convenient. I tried their waterproof Ulta brand mascara, and mascara sealer (both $4), and they worked amazing! Idk if they're cruelty-free, though. :/ I'm switching to all CF, so I should've checked. 

Ulta has a ton of fragrances, a lot of the newest hairstyling appliances, and some of the most beautiful hair accessories (barrettes and headbands)  I've seen in ages.

I checked Pricey, because the prices can go from Moderate to $18 for a bottle of nail polish. Also be sure to ask before you have a hair service what the price will be. My hair was $80, not the $55 listed on the menu. That's okay, but be aware to ask, it may be more depending on what you get, like mine was.

I made an appointment a week in advance with Haley and ended up with another girl who really seemed like she just wanted to gtfo out of there.

It seemed like she was the only girl who was even there. She said I should reschedule for another day when they would ""have more time"" but funny how the day she suggested left exactly 5 hours before the store closed, just like on that day.

I knew better but it shouldn't be this way. I need a forever hair stylist that doesn't want my soul to make my hair look good. I called in good faith and asked for a color specialist (they all say they are and that it's their favorite part of styling :-/ )... anyhow, Emily assured me that their newest stylist (Katie) was a color correction specialist and she wasn't new to de industry, well 3 years isn't what I call specialist level specially because I'm pregnant and she obviously used the wrong volume to do the processing of my hair and left patches everywhere. She still uses the board and she dropped it a few too many times on the floor that I felt bad for all of them. It's funny how I was joking with her that I hated 2000's chunks of hair that was called highlights just to make sure she used a fine technique when grabbing my highlights, wishful thinking. My appointment was at 1 but I was running 15 mins late but it didn't matter because I had to wait for my stylist to be done with her previous appointment for another 30 mins (that's 45 mins I would of have to wait if I wouldn't have been late). I told her time was an issue but I wasn't done until 5:30 and unhappy. I told her I was for sure calling back. Color was super ashy with the outside light and she chopped my hair off, not really a real hair cut where she would of have noticed the shorter side on it. Nice girl but need to really practice and listen to her clients and if she can't deliver is best to say so. No shame on that, trust me. 

Mistake #2... going back to ""fix"" it. 7 years and I don't know why she did what she did... ""Your hair looked better with the 1st mistake"" ( my husband's words and he is the one that tells me I look amazing even if I'm wearing a trash bag) so yeah. Amber removed the toner Katie put on, barley blended the patchy places and threw another toner that gave me a color if Katy Griffin's hair had a baby with a M&M. She also ""fixed"" the cut by using some special technique. Well tell that to the ponytail lol (see pic. Lol).

I will say they were very polite and willing to try to fix the mistake and never changed their attitude to an ugly unpleasant experience.

However, I'm always open to a second opinion from staff, since I assume they are passionate about makeup to be working there (won't make that mistake again). I shade matched myself with a product I'm extremely familiar with, the It Cosmetics CC Cream. I have recently started using tanning lotion so I needed a shade or 2 darker than my usual Fair Light, and yes I knew the nature of product's oxidation. As I was reaching for my new shade one of the staff asked me if I needed any help shade matching. Since I was wearing a mask for Covid regulations and couldn't sample the product on my skin (had to rely on bottle color), I said ""sure, I wouldn't mind a second opinion."" I was then swarmed by 2 other staff members when the first couldn't decide which shade of the 2 I brought to her was best, and then one of the 3 staff members asked me if I wanted a foundation. I said no, I wanted a CC cream. She then responded to me in an extremely bitchy tone, ""what do you mean by CC cream??"" as if I'm the one with the crazy ideas. Anyone who has even an inkling of the scope of the makeup world knows that CC's creams have become very popular in recent years because of the quality of their coverage combined with skincare ingredients and SPF. Just because Ulta staff isn't aware of them doesn't mean they aren't prevalent - big brands like Maybelline, Neutrogena, NYX, e.l.f., etc. all have their own versions that are named, you guessed it, ""CC Creams."" It's not MY problem the staff here isn't up to date on trends that are already years old. All 3 staffers then proceeded to tell me neither shade I chose would work, they were both too dark. Well, the next shade up was the one I already owned that was now too light, aka the whole reason I'm in there! I politely said ""guess I must be a shade in between, thanks anyway for your help."" Silence. Not only does the staff seem to have no concept of the makeup world, they don't even know how to make a sale. I was basically left with no other product options and left the store. Jokes on them - not one person in the staff was even aware that Ulta carries CC creams from DOZENS of other brands that one of them could have showed me and I would be open to buying. Instead I was met with terrible attitudes and made to feel like a fool at something I'm actually really good at.

Additionally, there was one other associate asking multiple times if she could help everyone...I just wish she had been there earlier in my visit.
I hadn't been to an Ulta in some time, and I think I'm good for a while.  I walked into a very busy store, which is completely understandable.  I was looking for a contour kit, a concealer, and possibly a brow kit.  I may as well have been looking for a unicorn, a leprechaun, and a pot of gold.  I was desperately trying to find a contour kit and could not.  I looked everywhere, then finally got someone's attention.  She said they have one but the contour color was the same color as my skin (I am black but probably somewhere in between the shades of Beyonce and Oprah- in Maybelline, that is Light Cocoa).  When I saw the color she was referencing, I was astonished and mildly offended due to the fact that my skin color is SO far off.  I could absolutely contour with that color.  I picked up the kit, but then I was so thrown off, I didn't even want it anymore.  I did end up spending a pretty penny in there, but I wasn't in love with this person, who seems to be someone of some type of importance since she was literally speaking into her little earpiece the ENTIRE time I was there.
The first time I went through checkout, the associate was AWESOME, but I ended up having to go through again because I got an incorrect item.  I ended up going to Ms. Earpiece's register.  She completed the transaction, handed me my bag, and as I was thanking her, she just began speaking into her earpiece again.

The store has so much stuff! I really wanted to spend more time playing with the makeup and creams but I was short on time. I had to do a couple of double takes when I saw the brands I usually have to go to Sephora for. I don't know why but I always thought they just had grocery store brands at Ulta. The store was really clean and organized and there seemed to have a lot of people walking around doing demonstrations. 

Veronica asked me a lot of questions since I wasn't sure what I wanted a far as color went. She offered several suggestions and showed me what the color would like next to my skin. Honestly, I was in such bad shape she could have just dyed my hair black and it would have been better than what I had. I knew exactly what I wanted for the cut and Veronica said she understood exactly what I wa looking for. Her prices seemed to be right around what I was paying across the street at the mall so I wasn't stressed about that but I really appreciate her telling me up front. Veronica also told me that if I had an Ulta loyalty card I would earn points for all my services. BONUS!!! Can't get that at the mall. 

While my hair was processing I sat in a separate room where the shampoo bowls are. I saw that they a nail station. One of the other stylists told me they just do gel polish and that she had some time if I wanted to freshen up my nails. I desperately needed them done so I said yes please to that. That stylist, Carly, was really sweet as well and did a great job and she saved me a trip later in the week!

Veronica came back, shampooed me out and then took me back to her chair to do my cut. Veronica started talking about skin care and that they offer facials and waxing, that she only does hair but she could introduce me to those people before I left.  The next  thing I know I was done. I totally did not even recognize my self in the mirror. I had all this volume and body. I thought maybe she had used a curling iron or something, but nope just a leave in conditioner and a round brush. I rescheduled for my color next month because I guess she gets booked up really fast.

I heard her, only inches next to me say on her intercom ""hold on, I need to watch her"". She then proceeded to stand there and stare at me. I regret not saying anything. I should have. I don't steal, and this was insulting and uncomfortable.

I went in Feb 2014 for a haircut with Sara Dame a hair stylist at Ulta Salon Brandon. I came in with pictures and a very clear idea of what I wanted, which was the haircut Jessica Alba got around the same time, medium length hair in the back and longer in the front. Totally even all around except for obviously the front. What I came out with was extremely short hair that reached the nape of my neck and got progressively longer with the hair at the front reaching just above my collar bone. AKA a bob. Not what I wanted at all, nor resembled the pictures I had shown. Before she cut my hair we discussed how short I wanted it and I honestly thought she was going to stick to that. When I said it was so short she justified that I could still put it into a pony tail... a very low pony tail. She turned me away from the mirror during the whole process so I could not see what she was doing and cut. Then she gave me the absolute worse blow out ever given which she offered to fix with the straightener for extra charge! I was left with puffy, frizzy hair and she twisted up pieces and cut again. My hair was and still is uneven in places. The left side of my hair is longer than the right, it looks choppy and looks like it was cut off with a blade. NO two pieces of my hair are the same length!! Six months later and my hair still looks horrible but is more manageable when curled or waved.. straight hair is a disaster. Do not cut your hair here, idk about the other stylist but I would not after that nightmare. Last time I have ever stepped foot at Ulta.",2014,LA,Luisiana,27.9417732,-82.3217625,Y,8,0

I was met by Dawn who was on an emotional high - so high she could not focus on my hair.

Not everyone was as excited as her but I thought that's great - she had fun.  Except she never really stopped talking to everyone.

936,swK7WAxE1tGhMeVfwCySzQ,LAfBjmgtmIE0FqedMIyy1A,1.0,"DO NOT GO TO THE HAIR SALON HERE!!!!!
This Ulta has been going downhill for a while. It's always messy and unorganized, there's bins left on the floor in the aisles, the employees on the floor are rude and will point out flaws in your makeup, it's not clean or well kept, the employees seem miserable, and they're always out of stock of popular items. Me and my mom had a terrible experience at the hair salon in particular.
Last year we went to get our hair done here because we've always liked buying makeup at Ulta and figured we would have a good experience. I wanted ombré with platinum ends. My hair was chocolate brown. My hairdresser explained to me she wouldn't be able to get my ends all the way to platinum in one sitting and that I'd have to come back probably one more time. I didn't know anything about bleaching hair at the time but I was okay with it and wanted her to do what she could to get it as blonde as possible. My senior pictures were the next day so I still wanted it to look nice. She asked me if I wanted a solid ombré or this choppy style ombré she had done on other clients. I specifically said solid ombré and had a reference picture. I ended up with an orangey gold, unblended, I don't even know what to call it. I think she tried to do the choppy style ombré with streaks that she had done on other clients when I specifically asked for solid ombré. It looked terrible. There was a line between the brown and the orangey gold. There were parts that were so patchy they looked like hot topic patterned hair extensions. I even showed my hairdresser as she was leaving and she acted like she didn't see anything. My mom's hairdresser saw how bad of a job mine did and ended up blending some parts more with toner for me because my hairdresser left. I don't know what my hairdresser used on my hair but it didn't look good at all. I've seen good hairdressers take brown hair to platinum in one sitting. A few years back I had the same thing done at Fantastic Sam's in Sun City and they got my ends to platinum without major damage, and the ombré was nicely blended. It was much cheaper than Ulta, which ended up being about $200 each for me and my mom. My hairdresser at Ulta could have at least blended it nicely and toned it right.
My mom had a bad experience too. She wanted a balayage and had dark brown, almost black hair. Her hairdresser claimed to be the best colorist at the salon. She ended up taking forever on my mom because she had to strip the box color first, then work on the balayage. She took on another client about halfway through and worked on them both at the same time, which was a problem. She was rushing on my mom's hair and we didn't end up leaving until after 9:00 at night (started around 4:00). She wouldn't even style her hair at the end! My mom had to style it herself and this other hairstylist gave her an attitude when she asked for some hairspray. My mom ended up with red and orange streaks on the back of her head. Needless to say, when we walked out of there we were not happy.
We talked to the manager about the situation afterwards and she wouldn't refund us; instead she offered to ""fix"" our hair for free on another day. When she did my hair she was really nice and apologetic about it, but I don't think she even did anything but tone my hair because it looked the same, just gray, and the ombré wasn't fixed. My ends eventually faded back to that orangey gold color a week later. My mom's hair looked the same too, just slightly less orange.

I mentioned I was swatching before on my own.

But finally I gave in and I decided that I needed help. There was a girl working in front of the MAC products. So my mother kindly asked if she could see if there was anything she could do to help, and the girl responded by very rudely by saying that what's on the floor is all we have. And then she turned her back to us, and completely blew us off. I mean we didn't get a smile, a nod, she was straight faced and looked annoyed with us. And she wasn't assisting anyone else, so it's not like we were interrupting. I was actually shocked. I started looking around again and I probably looked pretty thrown off by what just happened.

Misinformed."" I actually thought it was nice of her to cover for her coworker. She then proceeded to go in the back and then she came back with exactly what I needed.

The girl working the mac station was the only person on the floor to help people and instead she was carrying on a conversation with a friend and wasn't looking around to see if anyone needed help. I couldn't find my shade of foundation and I needed some help to see if they were in the locked drawers underneath. I felt bad to interrupt her but I really needed help. I stood there until her friend noticed me and she was very polite but the Mac girl tried to still ignore me. Finally she acknowledged me and I asked her politely if she could help me just whenever she could I didn't mean to interrupt. She looked at me and said to go up and ask the front because they can look it up on their computer... there was a giant line.. did she want me to wait for someone to help me when she could have or did she expect me to skip the line? I just said ok and walked away grabbing a different product instead and going to checkout. I get to the checkout lady and asked her if she possibly had this in a stock and she had to go look in the locked drawers for my product. She was extremely helpful and kind and I felt really bad.

BUT the Ulta's near me have been notorious for being sneaky and not giving you the sale that they promote when your products are ringed up. My best friend used to go here a lot with me years ago. For example, if she would get a products that was ""Buy 1 get 1 free"" she would be charged for both items at ringup. She would either have to correct them at the register, or wouldn't notice until she got home. When I went last week, I decided the $55 hair curler and $30 eyebrow kit I got wasn't what expected, I returned it. I noticed at the register when she was doing the return that the curler scanned at $47 back to me. I told her it was more than $47 when I purchased it last week and she said, ""oh, its on sale right now"" but then turned to her manager next to her and asked to make sure that I just get the sale price back. Luckily her manager corrected her and said, ""no, she gets the full price back if thats what she paid, sale or not right now.""

I don't know if Ulta just prefers girls who don't know what they're doing, or maybe someone at these locations isn't registering all the sales into their computer prior to advertising the sales. Another thing is that the customer service and help is almost non-existent. An associate applying makeup to a customers face was approached by another woman who asked for help in finding a product. The associate said she would help her after she was  done doing the makeup for this other woman, but when the customer asked a different question nicely, the associate rudely said, ""I said I'll help when I'm done here"" Very rude and very unprofessional. There also was no one else to help this woman. I don't know if Ulta is understaffed or that their associates jsut like to crowd in a corner and chat for $8 an hour. I mean, that's what they're suppsoed to do, right?

1030,1xFpt3S7c-8wkE18oG6QqA,b9bwm23B7_nOQ0UNW1NGkQ,3.0,"This review will be based on a service I received here today. Made an appointment for a 60 minute customized facial. I've never gotten a facial before and pricing was reasonable here. 

My appointment was for 12:15pm. By the time we got started, it was 12:25pm. My esthetician's name was Aaryn. She confirmed I was getting a 60 minute service. I was asked to fill out a form regarding my overall health and skin type. Aaryn made small talk in the beginning and discussed my top 3 skin concerns with me. She descended the chair to the lowest position, told me to get comfortable and put a blanket over top of me. It was cozy. 

What I didn't like about this experience was that Aaryn didn't go over ANY of the products she used on my face. She could've put anything on my face and I wouldn't know because nothing was said. 
Another pet peeve was the fact that she kept getting up and walking away. She'd leave me in the chair with the product on my face and go elsewhere. She turned on a machine that released steam and I felt the heat and steam mist onto my cheeks. 

When she was done the facial, it was 12:59pm. Definitely not 60 minutes... I felt like I got ripped off because she was in a rush to finish the service. One of my concerns was redness in my cheeks. She handed me a mirror to show me the finished look and I felt like I had more redness than I did when I first got there. I asked her about a cool tingling sensation in my face and she explained that it was an exfoliating product she used that could be causing the feeling. 

Went up to the cashier to pay and Aaryn was nowhere to be found. She didn't go over any aftercare with me and I had to leave her tip in an envelope with another employee. It was kind of unprofessional. 

2.5 stars for this subpar service. Probably wouldn't get another facial here, but will still stop by to purchase makeup.",2019,PA,Pensilvania,40.158455,-75.143143,Y,4,0

On my recent visit to this Ulta, I had a different coupon. This one gave 20% off almost everything, including the high-end makeup brands that are usually restricted!! The cashier mentioned that Ulta only does that type of coupon a few times a year so if you happen to see it, don't waste it! 

My mom and I picked out some great items with the help of a couple ladies working.. Yes, we needed to get their attention, but neither copped any kind of attitude when we asked for assistance. I needed a new eyeliner and I was pleasently surprised when the salesperson pointed me toward a brand I had never used but that was a few dollars cheaper then the brand I was considering (and I am very happy with, now that I have it home!). Another salesperson was happy to apply some makeup for my mother so she could see if she liked it. People that have a hard time getting help may just need to speak up!

I love ulta for the products they carry--especially since they have both drugstore and high end options--as well as for the membership offers they have in addition to their frequent sales. I'm a platinum member and ulta credit card holder. I spend my money here frequently; in fact, I probably spend too much of my money here. And this most recent experience has me reevaluating  whether I should make sephora my primary make up store, instead of ulta. 

Even before today's experience I have always found the customer service experience at ulta lacking. Today was no different. I had an appointment at 2:15 for a 10 minute face fit facial. I had never been to the salon at ulta before and I only made this appointment because I had a coupon. 

I checked in at the salon desk and was greeted quickly, told that my facialist would be ready soon, and was provided with a bottle of water. So far so good. But when 5 minutes go by, I am getting impatient. I return to the desk and am told that she might still be with her previous client; there's no confirmation though and no employee seems concerned enough to double check;
There's also no apology. 10 minutes later, she finally finishes with that client at 2:30 and my face fit treatment starts at 2:35-20 minutes late. The face fit treatment itself was truly wonderful and She gave me many helpful pointers and insiders. I would rate that experience highly; however, it's the ancillary issues that are really aggravating. 

I not only had to wait longer for my appointment than it lasted, but then I also had to wait more just to check out. My facialist gave me my bill and told me that I needed to pay at the front. So that's what I did. Well 20 minutes later and I was still not checked out. I don't know what the deal is but every time I go to ulta the line is horrendously long because they only have one cashier, who is operating at a slow pace. This in addition to the coupon I had really got everybody mixed up and confused--because no one knew how to redeem the coupon--and it took forever to finally pay. It was ridiculous. It shouldn't be this complicated to use a coupon for your store. I was also told that I was supposed to pay at the salon desk; what the heck?! I don't work here--I'm just trying to be a patron but they made it really hard.

I came in today to purchase a bottle of foundation that I've been using for a while, though it may be time to do a color match again since I've tanned a bit this summer. I mention this because the last time I was in this store, I asked for help with a color match and got an eye roll; after about 15 minutes waiting with no one actually coming to help me I left that time. I mention this because I am not the prettiest woman for sure, and I don't wear a whole lot of makeup so I have felt intimidated and sometimes unwelcome by the staff. 

Today was different in that a very nice (and intimidatingly pretty) woman came up to me as she saw me searching the shelf and asked if I needed help. I mentioned my issue of not being able to find my foundation shade on my previous two visits, and she was beyond helpful- she looked, and when she also didn't find it, she offered to have it ordered and shipped to my house, and went further to offer to grab me a sample of the foundation so I would have some in the time it took to arrive.

The past few times I have gone in I have noticed some things that affect my rating.

1) The Benefit Bar: This is a wonderful idea and selling tactic for the brand but at this local, it looks unkempt. The products (testers) look as if they have been out too long and not sanitized (I wouldn't DARE even swatch them). The artists who are Benefit trained to do waxing, etc, don't seem to keep a very good schedule as I have seen lines of people waiting  for their appointments on numerous occasions. I have also seen these employee's neglecting customers as they chat and test out products themselves. I like some of Benefit's products, but this turns me off from trying anything else.
2) A few of the newer associates at the register are not too personable. There is no connection between associate and customer when I've come up to purchase. No general ""How was your visit?"" or ""Did you find what you were looking for?"" from many of the ladies.
I understand that people have bad days, but some seem to have a bad day, every day.
3) I feel as though some of the associates do not know their stock. I have come in asking for specific products and have received blank stares. I have considered applying to work for Ulta as I love Makeup and it's a huge part of my job as a performer. It is amazing to me that those who are already employed are not up to date on latest trends or current releases.

Usually when I go into an Ulta store no one really comes up to you and helps with any sort of enthusiasm but today was different.  I was in the market for a lipstick.  I knew what type of shade I was looking for.  Two lovely young ladies were both just rushing around the different counters looking for lipsticks for me and taking the proper precautions in setting the lipsticks so I could try them on.Wiping them down and sanitizing as needed.   I only asked one of the ladies her name.  She was Maria Martin and worked specifically at the Calvin Klein section.  She and the other young lady both were actively helping me.  Maria had a great sense of humor and even put some extra make-up on me.  I was a bit disappointed because my $3.50 didn't apply to the lines of lipstick I was looking for.  So much for any bargain.

A young woman asked if we needed help. My mom explained what she was looking for and we followed her to the L'Oréal area. She looked through the eyeshadows and eventually found two similar colors, one was considerably darker and the other had more red in it. Nevertheless my mom found one of them acceptable when applied to her arm, so settled on the color. The young employee searched through the bin for some time and did not find the color in stock. She said perhaps it could be shipped to home, then spoke briefly to a co-worker. When she returned she said there is a new way the ship to door (or whatever the method is called) is handled and that we'd need to go through the line and the person at the register would determine if the eyeshadow is available to ship. Immediately I wondered, why must we go through a line potentially to be told this eyeshadow is unavailable?!  Shouldn't one of the numerous workers here helping no one be able to tell us if this is available without standing in line??  Who makes you wait in a line for the opportunity to learn if you can get a product by mail?  Possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard but my mom wasn't bothered by it and we got in line. Thankfully it wasn't long but once we got to the cashier she also had to confer with a co-worker or two for several minutes to determine the eyeshadow we wanted to buy was not available. Soooo, why on earth is there a product on the shelf that is not available in store or by mail?  I suggested they should remove it from the shelf if it isn't available. A co-worker pushed back that it should remain there as it could become available later. 

So now we've waited in line for nothing and, mind you, not one of the four or five employees involved ever thought to show my mom a similar color in another brand. Not one!!! Instead they let us walk out without making a sale! Incredulous.",2021,LA,Luisiana,32.2848363689,-110.97488218,Y,11,0

1149,aa7nCvoM_4Qjvry5Kj11_g,iwSHtwr96TyhhnclQZHGEg,1.0,"I arrived 15 minutes early for a haircut w/ style and all over highlights. This was my 1st trip to Ultabeauty and I was excited. I only have my hair done every 6 months since it's so expensive. I arrived with naturally curly hair that reached my bra strap in the back. 
 I was left alone several times
( more than 3) for my stylist to answer the salon phone and once for an extended personal call. It was like i had arrived at Great Clips or some other walk-in salon. It took over 3 hours and 20 minutes for my services because of this delay, along with 20 minutes for her trying to get the color right with toner. 2 different tries.
 I needed to leave for a movie, but told her not to skimp on my hair because of this. I expressed this twice.
First thing that alarmed me was her saying she was only going to cut 2 inches ( since i told her i wanted to keep it long), but with her contined ""trimming"" which I thought was ""shaping"" ended up to be more like 4 inches once i really put my hands through it. I entered the salon with the length at my bra strap and now it is barely below my shoulders.
 This made me really really sad to say the least. 
It's like she had never been educated that curly hair shrinks when it dries.  (????!!!!)
Her skills contined to shine (sarcasm) ....To start the ""style"" she began blow drying my hair on high power and heat without a diffuser and proceeded just to straighten the front with a round brush, and scrunching the back. Let me tell you. That's not a good look. She asked why I kept putting my fingers through it, and I told her I didn't like it fuzzy. However, she didn't do anything about this, she just jumped into scheduling me again in 3 months. 
I wanted to sit there and demand she do things over, correctly, but at that point and time, I had been there over 3 hours and 20 minutes, and with a movie previously scheduled with my family at 4pm and being in pain sitting there for so long (putting off another back surgery) it just wasn't an option. 
I literally wanted to cry when I got the $210.00 request for payment. 
I got out my debit card to pay at their register, but was told I couldn't pay at the salon, I had to pay up front. Up front was a line of 15 people waiting to check out. 
This was the cherry on top because there was only 2 sales associates working to check these (now 16) people out, while I counted 7 sales associates just lazily walking through the store with a tool belt full of makeup brushes asking through their nose if they could help you.
Too many ridiculous things happening in a row for me to ever return to this joke of a salon. I'm spreading the word so no one I know goes in to pay hundreds of dollars to stylists who act like they've never worked with anything but straight hair, and have all their hair unexpectedly chopped off that they've been working so hard to grow.

It is a really big well lit store and probably has anything you are looking for by way of nail polish, makeup, shampoo, beauty products, etc.

But considering that I was the only one in the store when it opened for the day you'd think that I'd have a salesperson walking alongside of me asking if I needed help.

There were 4 salespeople, one manager and 1 Clinique exclusive representative there.
I had to find a salesperson 3 times to direct me to the product I was looking for.  I did ultimately find what I wanted and then I had to find a person to ring me up.

I do not shop here on a regular basis-  I came in because I wanted 2 items like ""now"" rather than waiting for them to come from online shopping............

She enhanced my natural brow shape and made my face look more symmetric.

Alicia and the district/regional manager were there when i went to get my refund yesterday.  Alicia was again very nice and professional.  The other manager seemed to not be so friendly and made some comment of how strong my daughter was....idk if that was in reference to her going to therapy both speech and physical and not really believing what i said to be true but it sure felt like it.  My daughter is strong because of the work we've done for 5 months and can move her head any direction now thank you and chokes alot less now but still has to have a procedure done thank you but she wouldn't know anything about that since what my daughter has is very rare so maybe she should just stick to working at Ulta.

I ended up getting the dimensional which I guess I was wrong with what I thought it would be.  Well blended highlights and lowlights is what I expected with the underneath of my hair being solid.  I have chunks of highlights going down my part....what is this 2002?  Anyway, besides the fact that my hair did not turn out the way I expected it to I paid a lot of money for very subpar service.  She was too busy doing the hair of another Ulta worker and her son while I was sitting there processing for far too long.  Someone else checked me and rinsed me while she played around and spent a lot of time on this other workers sons hair.  After that she was in a rush to get me out.  Barely cut my hair and just blow dryed it but by this point I was done.  I told her I wanted to be surprised when I put on my glasses but the truth is I could see how chunky my highlights were and I was not happy whatsoever.     As for the cut of my hair she basically was like oh lets just make it a little shorter in back and took five minutes on me instead of treating me the way she did the little boy.  You could tell the girl who rinsed my hair knew what was going on and she was very sweet and tried to make up for my stylist short comings.  At this point I just didn't care anymore.  I wanted to get out of there and get home.  Unfortunately I will be going to Sally's today to purchase something in a box to cover up these chunky highlights it's so embarrassing with them at work but I couldn't do it last night.  This was really something I was looking forward to as it was my first Mother's Day gift and having a baby with some special needs and haven't had time for myself whatsoever in-between just being a new mom and taking my daughter to speech therapy, physical therapy, and a chiropractor.  This was a total flop and I will never return. And to make things worse i was over charged.

Unlike other estheticians, Jenna is so friendly, but doesn't try to converse with you during the entire treatment if she picks up that you'd rather be quiet. She lets you know what she's doing as she does it, makes sure you're doing okay, etc. but doesn't bog you down with asking you a million questions about your life and your opinions while you're trying to relax. This is a HUGE plus. She doesn't ignore you, either, by just plopping you in the chair and getting started, as I've heard some estheticians do. Also you get an arm massage during the facial...I'm starting to sigh, literally, right now, just thinking about it.

Alisha always somehow figures out what I want to do with my hair even though I have the explaining ability of a five-year-old. She also lets me know what condition my hair is in. I didn't get my hair cut for what was probably several years and Alisha cleaned it up without any problem. I used to think that if your hair was long, it didn't make any difference if you had it cut regularly; was I ever wrong. My hair looks so much better for Alisha's skill and tips.

The only downside is the fact that during sales a lot of the best brands are excluded.

FOUR HOURS LATER, yep you read that right 4 HOURS LATER (no cut either just color) I left with severely damaged hair that was FRIED at the roots and tips.  To top it all off they even charged me for the train wreck job they did... but they gave me 20% off, woohoo.  It was THE WORST hair experience I have ever had in the past 10 years I've been going to salons.

I have done the Keratin treatment thrice before tying it out at your salon.
Hence, very familiar with the process and the after results. My hair being dry and frizzy shows fantastic results post keratin and it lasts for as long as good 4 months. But this time, its as good as I didnt get a keratin done.
My hair is just the same as before. I spent around 200$ (keratin+haircut) and it was for nothing. I can walk in today and show it to you but I know it would not change anything for me. 
While undergoing the treatment I did noticed the difference in the process itself but I thought why not wait for the results and then decide.
Results - neither softer, nor manageable hair. Looks frizzy and dry just as before. Its been a month to the treatment and everyday I look at my hair I feel cheated. 
I walked out of the salon unsure and confused. As days passed I realized what a blunder it was.
Absolute no value for money. I came to you for the keratin thinking that your a brand and could be trusted. I guess not! 
You should be sorry for the kind of service you give people for a $200 bill.
Sorry Ulta, your are just not worth my money.

After being at the salon for 3.5 hours she decided to start the color over. There was no manager there to assist her and I felt like she was just guessing. By the time I left it was 11 pm and the store had been closed for an hour. Woke up the next day and began flat ironing and noticed one side was significantly shorter than the other. I called the salon and talked to Michelle, the rude manager. She told me to come back and she'd ""take a look"". She was cold, made up excuses and did not make me feel like she was ready to fix the mistake her employee made. She said ""they told me you guys were here late last night because you didn't want to leave with your hair the wrong color"". Excuse me? Do you want to walk around with your hair two separate colors? I don't think so. She completely ruined the chances of me giving the stylist another shot. Too much attitude for a manager!! Just apologize and move on, no one (especially an already upset client) needs your sass. I added pictures of the color and cut problems.",2017,MO,Misuri,28.09621669,-82.50410304,Y,1,0

I wanted to get back to my roots (literally) so I could grow it out and focus on helping my curls opposed to color care. Arlene worked on me between her other clients to ensure I was cared for, and was a very colorful person who had more years of experience than I've been alive and a beautiful mess of curls herself so I felt confident in a potentially terrifying process. She gave me lots of good information, and made me feel cared for. She had me come back the next day as my hair hadn't reacted as planned to fix it, and I felt very cared for in the process. In love with my new brunette locks and love that she took extra care to match to my roots and not disrupt the natural hair that had come in. My retail experience was nice as well, I got help from several staff members who helped me shade match the Urban Decay Brow Blade to my new color so I can look sharp tomorrow for work.

I walked in & was greeted by a woman at the front desk, I then continued my way through the store. I made it to the NYX section and it was just plain ugly for lack of a better word. There were SEVERAL items missing (do they even do stock check/inventory here?), the display drawers are beat up, colored & drawn on, have used makeup all over them. They were so covered with makeup that when I pulled my hands from the drawers my hands were red from lipstick. Now I know that the staff isn't putting makeup all over the drawers (the customers are) but you would think that the staff would reset the areas and keep them presentable. I can tell this staff doesn't care much about appearance because the other makeup displays/area was completely in disarray. While the staff could have been cleaning up/ organizing on this fairly slow Sunday they were chattering in front with one another. No one even bothered to ask the few customers in the store if they needed help or bothered to greet the people.

I came to use a $5 off of a Ulta Beauty purchase of $15 or more coupon I received on a previous visit to this location.

I love the new line of workout makeup products by Ulta Beauty. The mascara, lip stain, and brow gel last the long sweaty runs and lifting sessions. The prices for the products are reasonable when using a coupon or when they are on sale. 

After locating my needed products, I headed to the checkout. They had two registers up and running. The line was up and moving. At the register I handed over my coupon, and she scanned it. The coupon did not work. The cashier read the ""rules"" and said she did not understand why it was not working.

Unfortunately, their first impression was so bad, that I did not stay for my consultation and doubt that I will be returning.

I arrived 5 minutes before my appointment, checked in, and told the person helping me that it was my first time there. The staff member told me that my stylist was ""just finishing up"" and asked if I would like to take a look around the store or have a seat. I said that I would like to be seated, but I had to ask where because she failed to show me where and I couldn't identify the seating area. 

As I waited, I noticed one stylist that seemed to be finishing up. However, when she finished, she asked someone else that was waiting to the chair. I was dismayed that this was not my stylist as all of the other stylists did not seem anywhere close to being finished. By this point, it was 10 minutes past my appointment time and I was finally able to catch the attention of someone. This staff member pointed out who my stylist was and said that she would make sure that my stylist knew I was here. The staff member (not my stylist) came back to report that she is ""just finishing up."" After 5 more minutes, the woman's hair was still so wet, and I was not impressed with how long I had to (and still had to) wait.

I am not sure about you, but ""just finishing up"" means 5 minutes (10 minutes at most). I went back to the front desk and asked the woman to cancel the appointment, the woman asked if I was sure since my stylist was ""just finishing up."" My appointment was supposed to be a 30 minute consultation that would have been half over by this point. I know that my consultation was free, and I would have felt differently if this was not my first time there and I had met my stylist before. However, this was a horrible first impression. I felt that my time was not valued--that I was not valued.

When attempting to make the purchase with my Apple Pay at the first register I was told that there were issues with the Apple Pay so I was sent to another register with the same cashier ( I'm assuming she didn't even know what she was doing due to her constant need for assistance). The transaction went through seamlessly, or so I thought. This all took place September 19, 2021. This morning September 21 I logged onto my chase mobile account to see an additional charge of $100 from Ulta, which doesn't even reflect on my Apple Pay transaction.

What I like is that they have EVERYTHING.  Go to your local drugstore and you're faced with a plethora of the big name/inexpensive brand choices.  Go to other beauty supply stores and you have your pick of high end beauty merchandise.  Here?  You have it all.  This, I love, because my favorite mascara just happens to be one that can be found almost anywhere.  My favorite tinted moisturizer, on the other hand, is a more exclusive brand of organic makeup that can be difficult to find.  I like being able to get both in one place.  It's a one-stop-shop for all your beauty/makeup/hair necessities. 

I'm a big fan of their Ulta brand liquid hand soap (I haven't purchased a scent that hasn't proved to be fabulous).  Around the holidays, they have a wonderful supply of gift ideas that are sure to stuff your stockings full of loveliness.  They carry Bare Mineral products (yes!).  And, have an impressive array of perfumes in their perfume section.

I went to my local store and saw some Whish products on clearance. I purchased some and went home and used them. Loved them and came back for more the next day. I loved them so much, I contacted family in Idaho to see if they could go to their Ulta to purchase for me ( I am in Indiana). My sister said she would and went to the Boise Towne Square Location on Milwaukee. She got there and saw a full shelf of product, (she sent me a pic) but it was not on clearance. I asked her to see if she could get a price check on it. She asked an associate if they could price check it for her. The associate took one to the register and it rang up 1 cent. My sister said the associate looked like a deer in headlights, like something was wrong. She called over her manager (Alicia-spelling might be incorrect) and the manager told my sister that this was incorrect and that the product is no longer for sale. I sister called me and told me this. This did not make sense, so I called the manager myself after my sister had left. She told me that the product is defective and that they were all testers and they can not sell anything. That she has to return it to the manufacturer, that they wont allow her to sell anything. Still, this made no sense. What made sense to me, was this was supposed to be on clearance, this store did not have their act together and have it marked on clearance, and perhaps it was time to get rid of the product.She told me AT THAT Very moment the product was being pulled to send back to the manufacturer.  At this point, there is nothing she or I could do. After that conversation, I reached out to Whish company themselves and wanted to verify this information. Just as I thought, the response I got was that it is up to the STORE, not the manufacturer what they do with the product. They would not be requesting this product back. I let them know that this store is OUTRIGHT refusing to sell it to me, and I believe it is because of a  mistake they were making but did not want to admit to it. I was told again, that this is Ulta's issue and that is had nothing to do with them. My reply was very courteous and informative. My husband decided to call and talk to the manager. He was told that there was NO PRODUCT but some self tanner to be sold. (This is contrary to what she told me and my sister-before she was not allowed to sell anything!) She also said that it was not on clearance and would not be (same thing she told me). My sister came back the next day to see if in fact this was true.  SURE ENOUGH, my sister found shelves of product FOR SALE and ON CLEARANCE! She sent me pics of this as well as the original shelf where she saw the product the day before.

Against my better judgment and giving this store ANY BUSINESS, I had her purchase what I wanted, because I could not get it anywhere else on clearance. That night, my husband called and talked to the manager again. We have both conversations on recording because his phone defaults to this in case we need it for anything. This blows me away...seriously. This manager replied to my husband after he noted that my sister went in and saw shelves on product and on clearance for sale...that it must have been product people returned. She said that she has no idea how that product got there and marked on clearance, because SHE is the one that did what ""little"" product they had. My husband told her we have pics of the product they have, she said again, she did not know how it got there. She failed to admit that this product was NOT to be sold as originally noted, she did say that perhaps the manufacture sent MORE!!!

Thankfully they aren't terribly busy in the back by the restrooms but it's not always just women in the store.

Beyond Bare Minerals, they also have a great selection of other products from Too Faced (love their ""lip injection extreme"" lip plumper), to drug store brands like Loreal (their voluminous mascara is my fave), as well as hair products, and nail polish/utensils.

Britt is truly passionate about what she does and it shows that she enjoys her career as she is constantly taking the time to learn and progress to become even better than she already is (if that's even possible!). She really will go above and beyond for her client from what they would like done to their hair to easy scheduling. Britt is perfect to go to for any hair need such as cuts, colors, and even hair extensions. When you are in the salon chair with Britt, it's like hanging out with a friend. She is truly a genuine person. After going to Britt the first time after going to other stylists at various high-end salons in the area, I knew I never needed to go through the search of finding a stylist who would fit my hair needs and budget. I have very long hair that I want to keep long and healthy, I trust Britt 100 percent as she is always on point and delivers more than you walk in expecting every time.

I value that more than anything. She cares about the condition of your hair and wont agree to do something that will damage it. Even if someone else told you it could be done, believe her if she says it's a bad idea. Britt won't make promises about your hair that aren't physically possible. She isn't going to mislead you just to take your money.
If she tells you you need a treatment... you need a treatment. If she says you need a cut... you need a cut. She isn't shy about taking a photo to show you exactly what shes talking about. If anything, you'll need to reevaluate your friendships after she shows you what they've been letting you walk around with

Number 1, apparently the ULTA in CLEARWATER FL needs a new stock team/manager whatever. Everything I tried to look at and liked was out of stock. That was AT LEAST 3 different shadow palettes and 2 different contour palettes.

Then the store associate directed me to a MORPHE palette. Iv heard of this brand but I don't know much about it besides Jefferee Star talks about it on his little channel. So I said ok the colors in this palette are nice and wow it's so cheap I wonder why? But thinking oh it's Ulta they have good products even if it's on the side cheap side of the store. I take it home not thinking to even look at the ingredients or where it's made. Today I flipped it over and I found out it's made in CHINA. NO WONDER why it's so cheap. These products everyone rave about, contain some not so nice ingredients in them that can harm you down the road. Not to mention it's not cruelty free. Especially coming from China.

On the other hand, when I go into Sephora lately they are much more welcoming and seem like they actually have genuine opinions on products and want to help. 

Not too long ago I came in here and asked the girl for a basic, hydrating under eye cream. She recommended me a 65$ anti wrinkle cream from a random high end brand, mind you I'm 19 years old... I stated again ""oh you know I just want a good hydrating one, maybe 20-30$"" her response was ""you should check the drug store"" and walked away. Customer service of the year, folks.

She reached out and told me to come in later for my appointment, then ran an hour over when she told me to come in. I came in with hair healthy enough to stand a color correction, I had a consultation with 4 other stylists & loved Melissa's energy so I booked with her. Lightener was left on my ends for 30 minutes, applied incorrectly and not close enough to my outgrowth, while she walked away to get her lunch & eat. You don't leave lightener unattended like that. Then came back and applied lightener to my regrowth & the dark, precolored spots it should have originally been applied to and let that process for an additional 30 minutes. When she finally rinsed me out, she was calm & cool until walking away & coming back freaking out about how my hair was breaking & that this was my fault bc of previous colors, insisting that I cut 4-5 inches off of my hair. I told her to tone me & stop service bc i no longer trusted her with my hair, in which she continued applying different products before finally toning my hair. I spent 35 minutes crying at the shampoo bowl bc a stylist I put faith in failed, as a stylist the integrity of hair is most important and at no point did she offer other options during the lightening stages. I was open to options if I could not reach my end goal, but she instead chose to ignore the integrity of my hair for an end goal, thanks for the hot roots. The whole experience was awful and unprofessional, leading back to her rinsing a test strand out of my hair by having me crouch next to the shampoo sink with a towel over my face & getting my face all wet. I should have stopped service when I originally was concerned, but I figured there was a reason she was doing things the way she was, although no other stylist I know & was speaking with during my service condoned any of the things she was doing. I now have ridiculous amounts of breakage that have to be cut, and a chemical burn from lightener on my scalp. The store manager said that they cannot do anything for me unless I come in during certain times, I do not live local nor am I waiting to have my hair cut to fix the damage or see a doctor about the chemical burns. I still paid, and I still tipped.

I then went to check out with a few small items I didn't really even need, and the associate helping me used my ulta rewards points without asking me if I wanted to. He said something about not having the birthday gift and threw ""next months birthday gift"" in instead. 
It is literally the second day of the month first of all. Second of all if they had said they were out I would have told them I didn't want the item and would have waited til the end of the month to see if anything else came at the tail end.

After pricing a few frequently used items here, i.e. make-up, shampoo and conditioner, perfume, I've found the items are no less inexpensive and all can be found online for a more reasonable price. The quality of the products are questionable, as well. I purchased a bare minerals make-up brush that shortly afterward the brush hair started falling out and the handle came completely unglued. The cherry on top was finding out it was exactly the same price as the brushes you can purchase at the BM store in the Fashion Mall.

I have also noticed the lack of cleanliness and organization on their display shelves. This could be for a number of reasons and having worked retail before, I find this to be blatant neglect.

I left thinking I was crazy. I then called later after being told by a friend that my hair did indeed look odd. I called the store hoping they would rectify the situation. The nice lady on the phone said she would take care of it and to head on over. I drove 18 minutes (of a 20 minute drive) and I was called back stating ""the manager has to look at it- she'll call you tomorrow at 9 am"" I offered to send pictures to the manager to prove that my hair does indeed look bad, to which the lady on the phone said no... annoying. I drove home. Then today, I made sure I was free at 9 am. No call. She finally called around 11 am. The earliest availability (because the manager doesn't work in the evening?) would be Saturday in the afternoon. I even offered to come straight after work when I got off at 4:30 pm, and the manager stated she is leaving at 5 so she can't help. That would mean I have to cancel my weekend plans for a haircut.

The person who had done my nails was nice enough to have me come back and get a redo free of charge, but I'm not sure I'd go back again.  You're just sitting at a little desk at the back of the store, which isn't very relaxing, and the gel manicure was just that---putting the polish on, but no soaking your hands/cleaning up your cuticles etc.",2013,NV,Nevada,39.90864369,-86.10738764,Y,6,0

Today I walk in about 4:45 before the evening crowd to get my eyebrows done before I leave to go out of town for the holiday weekend. I walk in, it's not busy really at all. There are about 4 girls behind the check out counter. I walked in looked to the eyebrow bar and about a minute later I approached the check out counter to see if I could get some assistance. 

Now - they publicly let people know that they welcome walk ins, and that is how I have ALWAYS had my brows done, just by walking in at different times of the day. A woman comes from behind the counter and mildly seems annoyed but i understand she works retail and the next 72 hours are about to be insane. Instead of her being polite or even seeming like she wants to help me - she flips through a book on the brow bar and says yeah I don't have a single thing til 7:40 or 8 pm. Okay let's be realistic it's not even 5 pm, I literally said ah I'm sorry, I drove 30 minutes across town to come here and I can't wait until 8 pm. I asked her about waiting for a bit if the esthetician was at lunch or something and that I didn't mind to wait a bit. She did told me no not until those two times only. Now when you have a specific service you offer, wouldn't it be smart to have someone able to provide that service during your open hours and not at the very end of the night? I am frustrated because she was not friendly and seemed annoyed that I was just trying to pay for a service I get all the time.

First time, I simply walked out. I still went back a second time, thinking it was a fluke, and had one of the worst experiences. I went in on Wednesday, January 31st around 8:40 and made my purchase at 8:47. 

As I was making my purchase, Erin, never said hello to me let alone ask me if I found everything alright. When I tried to present a coupon to use - she said it wouldn't work on sale items. I made my purchase and walked away without any questions. I moved to the side and read the fine print. Not once did it say anything about not being able to be used on sale items. So I went back to Erin and explained the situation. All she could say was ""oh"". She asked Charlie, the Manager, if the coupon was valid. Charlie said yes. As they were making the adjustment and giving me a refund, both acted as if this was such an inconvenience to them. It was Erin's fault to begin with. She should have read the coupon instead of assuming that it wasn't valid on sale items. 

Not once was there an apology from Erin (the original cashier). After Erin walked away, I asked if she (Charlie) was the manager and she said yes. I began to politely explain to her how poor Erin's customer service was and how I didn't even get a simple sorry for this issue. All Charlie could say was ""I'll address this with her"". Even Charlie didn't say sorry! I had to say ""you could apologize on her behalf"" and only after that did she I get a measly sorry and a full stare down. 

I called Ulta Customer Service right after this poor experience and filed a complaint with Dalton. I explained the situation. He informed me that Dana Aicher, the District Manager, would be in contact with me in the next 24-48 hours. I guess we will see if she makes an attempt at making this situation right before I try to go another higher route with Ulta Corporate. 

All in all, you're in the customer service industry. If you feel like you can't talk to a paying customer in a polite way, you shouldn't be dealing with people! 

I wish giving 0 stars was an option. Even giving just 1 is too much for how rude the staff is at this location. I guess it's my fault too though. I should have learned my lesson after my first visit.

The service...it's hit or miss.  Whenever I ask for a product or a brand, they say it's on ""___"" floor.  I end up going back and forth 2-3 times asking someone where exactly it is.  Most of the employees don't even know what exact products Ulta carries, which is really a shame.  I asked if they had Vinylux nail polish and they sent me to the drugstore area.  Hold up, they obviously have no idea what this is because it certainly is not a drugstore product.

I booked an appt with Scott, and don't think I will ever let someone else color my hair ever again. He knew exactly what I wanted and wouldn't stop until I left the salon happy. I could tell even when my hair was wet that all the brassiness was gone!! He even recommended products to help me maintain my new hair, which I have subsequently ordered. Furthermore, he was incredibly personable and my two hours in the chair flew by with great conversation. He even gave me some great restaurant/nightlife suggestions, which I appreciate since I'm new to the city.

I have very fine brows, so I usually self-maintain - but I'm unable to recreate the shape and arch that Dianna is able to achieve.  She is extremely meticulous - starts with wax, trims them with scissors if necessary, and finishes with tweezers to catch any stray hairs.  She will also fill your brows back in with Benefit products and will add concealer to hide the inevitable redness that happens when you get a wax.

Cons: I haven't found the floor staff or cashiers to be particularly friendly or helpful -- in fact, I'm not sure any of them have ever even asked if I needed something on ANY of my trips there. If you ask a question, they give a curt answer which 50% of the time is ""I don't know."" Not awesome. 

I also wish they had a better return policy and offered more samples like Sephora does.

The Salon: LOVE! I've had a variety of services here, with several different staffers and been very happy each time. Pricing is on par or a little cheaper than the local salons, staff is friendly, and they know their stuff.

I rarely get my brows waxed anymore because they're really not that out-of-control (I am a natural blonde with fine hair). But, I did this as a treat for the first time in two years. Dianna suggested a tint as well as the wax, but was not pushy about it. I decided to go for it and I am glad I did.

Unlike Sephora, there were no applicators or makeup remover set out, and half of the products didn't have a tester available. I also got dirty looks from staff every time I touched something, and at one point a security guard started following me around as if he thought I was going to try and steal something! I had on my professional work clothes and my purse was closed, so I have no idea why he would go through so much trouble to make me, the customer, feel uncomfortable.

Very pathetic and I was offered no assistance the whole time, not that I really wanted it from any of the nasty ladies there anyway. After spending a grand total of over $200 from this Ulta location, I will certainly never return again and it's a shame because I actually did enjoy spending a few of my hard earned money at this beauty retailer the first and second time.",2014,LA,Luisiana,39.9500869,-75.1683553,Y,1,0

I had been wanting to try a new NYX foundation after a bunch of my friends have been raving about it. Ulta is the only place I knew sold it. It has been selling out like crazy, so Ive been checking in a few times a week on my way home from work to check it out. When it kept not being in the store, I considered ordering it online but decided i really wanted to test it first to determine which was the right shade for me, as that really depends on the product. I was thrilled to arrive at the store today and see that they had all 8 shades available!! Sadly, there was no tester available for the one shade i really wanted to try. Since there were testers for the 7 other shades, I decided to ask an Ulta employee if they maybe had a tester in the back I could try before committing to the purchase.

I walked upstairs, and approached an employee (her name was Taren or Taryn, not sure about the spelling.) Before I could even finish asking her about the tester. she put her hand to stop me from speaking, and begin telling me that they no longer leave testers for this product because they kept getting stolen. Now, this may very well be true, but seems unlikely to me as there were testers available for EVERY other shade, and testers available
for wayyyy more expensive and higher end products. When I went to make this point to her she again put her hand up and said, ""let me finish."" At this point, I was embarrassed and upset about how dismissive she was being so I said, ""Dont worry about it, I can tell Im inconveniencing you"", to which she abruptly turned and walked away.

Upset, I went to the register and asked the girl (who was very sweet and empathetic) if there was a manager available to speak with. As luck would have it, Taryn walked over and said she was the only available manager, to which I replied ""Nevermind."" She then laughed about it right in front if me, as if it were so funny that there was no other manager available to speak with. I was visibly
upset and she stood there and laughed. I immediately left empty handed and disappointed.

I would like to say that Ulta customer service has handled the situation appropriately, and this is much more about the individual than the store or the brand. I really hope that this manager improves her customer service skills as well as her basic respect for other humans. She may have been having a bad day, but she was truly heinous and it makes me nervous to think of encountering her should I shop at this location again.

I scheduled an appointment 7 days in advance, I left work early the day of the appointment, I arrived for my 5pm appointment and was told to have a seat.  I was then told that Diana was not in that day, i was immediately p*ssed off since this was planned in advance and there wasn't time for me to find someone else. Also, they had my number and could have called me to tell me that she wasn't in.  There were two Ulta employees there, one was trying to be helpful but the other seemed upset at the fact that I was upset. They also let me know that Diana told 'her regulars' that she wouldn't be in that day.

I don't care how good Diana is, she's not professional and the lack of customer service is appalling.

I've always been greeted & asked if I need help, & when I say no and that I'm just looking, they leave me be, which I like-I hate it in cosmetic places when the sales people are constantly up your rear end,& is the reason I avoid department store counters, I always feel so awkward when I'm just browsing or swatching or can't make up my mind & need time to think. I like that they have a large selection of brands, anywhere from high-end to drugstore brands, & they have a huge selection of NYX, which I like because the only other place near me that sells that brand usually is picked clean of their items, & either way doesn't have as big of a selection. And their selection of Urban Decay is actually slightly larger than the Sephora down the road, which is important to me because that's one of my favorite brands. They also have alot of sales on their brand & the drugstore brands. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars though is because sometimes it seems to take them a bit to restock some of the really popular items-like last 3 times I was there they still didn't have anymore Naked 3 or Lorac Pro palettes, which are very popular items.

But every once in a blue moon Sephora wont have a particular brand and Ulta usually will. I went in today for a NYX lipliner, I went downstairs and 1/3 of their lipliners were out of stock. Apparently I'm not the first to mention this problem. I was looking for the shade ""Brown"" so you'd think they'd have such a simple shade in stock, but no. I know in Sephora they keep extra stock below the shelves but Ulta doesnt have that so I went looking for someone (I was on the lower level) and there wasnt one person working down there despite there being atleast 10 customers downstairs and it being a Saturday afternoon. I waited to see if someone would appear but nope, no salespeople. I went to the counter downstairs and no one, customers were just walking behind the counter. Several of us were looking around for somebody. I gave up, went upstairs, and ended up getting a different lipliner with another company for $20 when I went in there for a $3 NYX lipliner. I shouldnt have to hunt down people who work there. They're on every corner of the store in Sephora, always asking if you need help and are so cheerful.

How do you spell ""worst customer ever ?""
""C-A-R-M-E-N.""
Went in with my Mom today to treat her to some nice perfume and dr Brandt 's eye depuffer.
We were pointed to the ""back of the store ""
We were clearly looking around as 2 women talked amongst themselves --both obviously spotting us--both ignored us completely . Guess the conversation was more important . Stood there for about 20 seconds while they talked and then finally walked up and ventured to ask--the one girl finally helped us and was pretty nice --this Carmen chick , as her name tag pronounced --turned on her heels and arrogantly clicked away .

Fast forward to me purchasing said items for mom at register and more clueless looks from mindless automatons . My Mom asked nicely if they possibly had any samples (you would have thought she had asked for their first born child)

Rude rude rude .

Fast forward yet another time in the same DAY because I had sprayed a perfume I loved and wanted to return and buy it and figure out what it was .

Walked past the counter where not 1, but FOUR to FIVE sales associates were congregating and shooting the breeze. I was about 2 feet from them for at least 5 minutes obviously looking for something and still not one of them asked if I needed help .

Ask again --same girl , Carmen, Rudely turns on her heels while same sweet girl (wearing a head scarf ) and another associate help me.


See Carmen blandly poised at the register where she looks severely put out that she has to deign to lazily ring someone up.

I asked the girls who were helping me ""
Is that your manager "" (knowing that sometimes the manager will have better things to do than answer questions (not really !) and defer to the associates .

Nope . Not a manager . Just a brat .

And to top it off the whole back of the store is a hot MESS and jumble of racks that need to be Re shelved.

Wonder if these girls could be doing something useful .

I will return because it's right by my office , but not for the awful and rude customer service .

Awesome selection of products but I've been greeted by too many people that make it clear they are too busy to answer my questions.

My first experience I went to buy a new hair straightener and wanted advice on a good brand in my price range. Who would be better to ask than one of the hairstylists? Well she obviously didn't share that same enthusiasm because she was annoyed that I was even speaking to her, but that didn't make me stop because I needed something and I wasn't leaving until I was satisfied with my purchase.

My next experience I went to get matched for some makeup since I had recently started a new job and wanted to feel a bit more polished. My roommate told me Ulta would match me to foundation and even show me some makeup tricks to apply them... well here's my luck, I asked if someone could help me with this little makeup tutorial but I was told they weren't doing that at that time because they were ""too busy this time of year"".... let's keep in mind it was about noon on a Wednesday and I was 1 of 4 customers there.....they ended up hurriedly matching me to some makeup and sending me on my way.

Alas, I return because now I want to get more, I'm a little puppy eager to learn new tricks! I approach someone and ask for a suggestion on a liquid eyeliner and listed my needs. Employee points me to her favorite.... which didn't fit any of the criteria I specified. Thanks for taking the time to let me know what you like, not what I want! Love that! 

Oh and to top this all off, website hours said they were open until 9, I arrive at 7:55pm to pick up something and was greeted by a slammed door in my face by security saying they were closed. I knocked on the door until finally the manager came up and she was SO RUDE saying that it's not her fault the website says 9pm. I would think someone in a manager position could push to get that fixed..

I will say I have had a few interactions with employees that are incredibly professional and knowledgeable, so I will be back, but I wish I didn't have to feel like I'm walking on glass whenever I'm here.

I came in here looking for a specific concealer that was a part of their 21 Days of Beauty promotion, only to find that they didn't carry it in-store.

 My sister and I brought our mother here for a full makeup makeover as a birthday gift. We were hoping for a MUA who could give a brief tutorial so we coud purchase ALL the products and she can do it later herself.

 Upon entering the store we were told to go upstairs to check in.  We were RUDELY spoken to by a hairstylist who didn't even look up when we asked to check in and just curtly said go downstairs, we told her we were sent upstairs... and she SCREAMED for another woman to come help us... (who happened to be sitting in the corner just watching, not even attempting to help)  She then denies we have an appointment, until we show her confirmation and she just goes ""oh your right here""????  Makeup artist was completely unprepared for us.

This doesn't seem that bad, but when your mom gets all dressed up and excited for  a rare moment of pampering...... !!!!  It just STARTED the experience off on a bad foot, oh but wait.


Finally she is seated for her makeup, the girl is nice but honestly it doesn't make up for the rest of the s*** show:

1. The makeup area is by what looks like the workers break area, thats fine, but its not fine when there what looks like day old chinese food and trash everywhere. I added a picture.
2. She applied moisturizer and primer with HER FINGERS.. EWWW, and I didn't see her wash her hands IMMEDIATELY before.... again my mother is being pampered im not going to interupt and make her feel grossed out.  She used brushes from a big tuberware container full of makeup and other things for the rest of the appointment which is again unsanitary
3.  The originally rude hairdress... proceeds to chomp on doritos about two feet away from my mom getting her makeup done and just watches?  in what world is this not annoying and bizarre.... then washed her hands without soap  and went back to the girl who's hair she was coloring =)
4.  A random customer came up out of nowhere and started asking questions, and the makeup artist left my mom sitting there for 10 minutes while she went to help her....where are the other workers?  It was a saturday evening!? 

Overall, her make up looked ok.  Nothing I couldn't do myself but its extremely frustrating that they got 300$ from us (again for the sake of my mom and her gift we didn't raise hell).  My sweet mom tipped her, and the makeup job was 45 dollars, plus the product that we bought.

My friend who's visiting me from Asia wanted some american makeup products so I took her to Ulta. She was excited and happy how big this beauty store is and literally wants to buy everything she sees, until she noticed that the security guard has been following us for the past hour. I brushed it off and tell my friend to ignore him and we walked away to see another brand.

I finally got ticked off when I catch him checking every makeup packaging to see if we stole anything. He literally opened every package that was on the stand we were at a minute ago and see if the package was empty. And he continued to followed us. (creep) 

As we were in line to purchase our stuff, my friend told me she wanted to switch another shade of a foundation. So I went to the basement floor real quick and change the shade. When my friend was in line, she noticed that the security guard was whispering to one of the register lady and he pointed at my friend and pointed down (assuming me, because I was in the basement floor at the time). 

As we were heading out, he walked beside us and perhaps expecting for the detector beep. But guess fucking what? It didn't. 

I personally think it was very rude and unpleasant of him to follow us to every corner of the store and assume that we were stealing. I come here a lot and wandering around to find the right kind of makeup is pretty normal. But for him, it didn't and made us look suspicious for no good reason. My friend felt uncomfortable and made her experience at Ulta horrible.

My negative rating has more to do with the overall experience. I was at the store by 11:15 for an 11:30 appointment. I was told by the manager that it would be ""just a little while"" until the girl doing make up on the first floor was done with her client, so I patiently waited and walked around the store.
When the girl doing make up on the first floor was done, she told me I'd be seeing someone upstairs, so she took me up there to wait...for 20 minutes. By 11:45 I went down to the manager and asked if someone would be with me soon, only for her to take me back upstairs to wait some more.

When my makeup artist was finally ready for me, we went back downstairs...after all of this running around and insanity, I didn't sit in the make up chair until 12:15. And, like most of their clients I am sure, I was pressed for time and rushing to get to a wedding. Ultimately this is unacceptable to me. You can't have stylists so behind in appointments that they make people wait for 45 minutes WHEN THEY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED. Ultimately there was little creativity offered to provide better service, and I left very unhappy.
As for the make up, it wasn't what I wanted, but it stayed put and I received many compliments.

This review is for The Salon and their service. I made an appointment online with Lauren at 3:30 pm for NYE. Then, I called to make sure that they were going to do what I wanted and also wanted ask for make up services. I wanted to get the Finger Curls. Got a guy on the phone who suggests that I book the appointment with him as Lauren didn't know how to do what I wanted.  His name is Ramon and he put me for 5 pm. 

A friend of mine asked where I was going to do my hair and I told her about Ulta. She made an appointment with Stephanie at the same time, 5PM. We both go there on time. I had been at Ulta before for their promotional blowouts and have been satisfied. Little did I know that some of them, that's all they know! I will further explain.

So, Ramon takes me after he was done with the last appointment. When I got there, I greeted them and said that my appointment time was 5 pm and that I wanted to get the finger curls. They had a manikin out with something called the Victorian Curls which was something that I did not want. So I show to him a couple of pictures so he knew exactly what I was looking for.

He washed my hair very quickly and started to ""complain"" by saying how much hair I had. Bla, bla, bla. But he was willing to finish with me before or around 6 PM. He knew what he was doing. He was almost done with the top part of my hair when Stephanie comes in and asks him to take her client/my friend as she wanted an up-do and she had no idea how to do it. So, he leaves me half/way and then she takes over. I was a little confused by the switch. At the end, I was there because I had no idea how to do that style myself. When I sat on her chair, though I couldn't see her face by the way of how she turned the chair, I could feel that she had no idea what the h*** she was doing. Stephanie started at the bottom, on the opposite way of how Ramon initiated it. Bottom line, I ended up getting a sort of blowout instead of finger curls. Curls were going in many directions.  I went home and fixed it myself a little bit. 

Thankfully, I have wonderful hair and it looks nice no matter what you do. I got my money back for this horrible service and I am writing this review to warn anyone that may need something fancy to be done with their hair for a special occasion - this is not the place.",2016,LA,Luisiana,39.9500869,-75.1683553,Y,1,0

Went in with my Mom today to treat her to some nice perfume and dr Brandt 's eye depuffer.
We were pointed to the ""back of the store ""
We were clearly looking around as 2 women talked amongst themselves --both obviously spotting us--both ignored us completely . Guess the conversation was more important . Stood there for about 20 seconds while they talked and then finally walked up and ventured to ask--the one girl finally helped us and was pretty nice --this Carmen chick , as her name tag pronounced --turned on her heels and arrogantly clicked away .

Fast forward to me purchasing said items for mom at register and more clueless looks from mindless automatons . My Mom asked nicely if they possibly had any samples (you would have thought she had asked for their first born child)

Rude rude rude .

Fast forward yet another time in the same DAY because I had sprayed a perfume I loved and wanted to return and buy it and figure out what it was .

Walked past the counter where not 1, but FOUR to FIVE sales associates were congregating and shooting the breeze. I was about 2 feet from them for at least 5 minutes obviously looking for something and still not one of them asked if I needed help .

Ask again --same girl , Carmen, Rudely turns on her heels while same sweet girl (wearing a head scarf ) and another associate help me.


See Carmen blandly poised at the register where she looks severely put out that she has to deign to lazily ring someone up.

I asked the girls who were helping me ""
Is that your manager "" (knowing that sometimes the manager will have better things to do than answer questions (not really !) and defer to the associates .

Nope . Not a manager . Just a brat .

And to top it off the whole back of the store is a hot MESS and jumble of racks that need to be Re shelved.

Wonder if these girls could be doing something useful .

I will return because it's right by my office , but not for the awful and rude customer service .

A skinny woman who had very dark hair, heavy makeup and looked to be about 40 told me she would be with me in a second. 

When I asked her where the brush sets were, she said something along the lines of ""We have a company that makes great brushes downstairs"" and instructed me towards the elevators/stairs. When my friends and I got down there, we were surprised to see that the lower level was all lower end cosmetics, and the most expensive, bad quality brush set down there was around 20$ max.

I am so offended that the woman was so judgemental and sent me to look at the cheap products instead of even showing me the more expensive options. I am by no means poor, and I was dressed nicely enough, but apparently the Ulta worker that was on her high horse deemed me uncapable of spending more than 20$ because I am in my 20s. While I was looking upstairs on my own, my friend heard her say something to another girl asking for help something like ""Well everything up here is going to be really expensive..."".. To which the girl responded ""So? Could you please show me anyways?"" Unreal.

You work at Ulta for a living. You are not better than any other human being, so please have the respect to treat every customer equally because you know nothing about them. I have never encountered such a rude employee.

This review is specific to my experience with the stylist named Helgada.  This review is not about the store

Not sure what prior experience Helgada has, but her skills are too bad even for Great Clips.  Doesn't listen to client request at all.  

-I told her I specifically DO NOT use a straightener on my hair and she looked at me like I have 5 heads.  If you know how to blow dry hair properly then there's no need to use a flat iron to reduce frizz. 

-I  asked multiple times for a concentrator to be used on the hair dryer, she told my multiple times it's not needed and that I'll see once she's done.  Finally she tells me she doesn't have a concentrator because she doesn't use them.  

-I don't know any legit hair stylist who uses a round brush to comb out dry hair.  Are you trying to damage my hair?! No I'm not talking while hair is being dried, I'm talking about when hair has been dried, then running a round brush down it from roots to ends ike Rapunzel combing her hair.  

-Icing on the cake was finally me asking her for the hair dryer and brush to fix it.  She wanted to know what exactly I didn't like about it.  Nicest way I could put it was ""all of it"".  So I finally trying to fix it myself to look halfway decent.  She then rushed to the register to print out my bill.

Ended up tying it back into a bun since it was just too pathetic to walk out with.  $45 for really just a wash, since I did the ""styling"" myself.

I called a month in advance to schedule an appointment for a hair donation, and I asked the lady on the phone (whose name I unfortunately can't remember) if my haircut would be free, as many hair salons do free haircuts when customers donate their hair. I also asked if Ulta would ship my hair to donation organizations. I was told yes and yes. One month later, I came to Ulta unprepared to pay for a haircut, but I kept five dollars cash in my pocket to tip my stylist. 

When the stylist cut my hair, she didn't use my natural part. In fact, she didn't use much of a part at all. My hair's new natural part is a crooked middle-part-gone-wayward part, and I have not used it since because of how poor it looks. After cutting my hair, the stylist washed my hair, did some more trimming with the same part, and then sprayed a few things in. She tried to blow out my hair, but I told her I don't like heat.

I nearly left the Ulta but was then handed a $70 bill (with a 20% first-time discount) and a plastic bag with my hair to donate (I had to send it out myself). 30 minutes of time and zero styling does NOT cost $70. Also, I was told on the phone that my cut and the shipping of my hair would be taken care of. 

I talked to the manager and she eventually lowered the price to $30. She said that *I* misheard the woman on the phone, and that the woman on the phone must have meant that Ulta will ship out my hair for free. Oddly enough, Ulta was not shipping out my hair for free anyway, so the manager's refutation was nonsensical. When I asked about adding the 20% first-time discount to the $30 fee, the manager said that going from a $70 cut to a $30 cut WAS my discount. That is not a discount. That is me paying the appropriate amount for the cut I received. 

I paid for the cut, and I kept the cash I set aside for a tip in my pocket. One could say that just like how a $30 cut WAS my discount, a $30 cut WAS a tip. I will not be returning to Ulta for any beauty needs whatsoever. The customer service is ridiculously horrible, practically nonexistent.",2019,LA,Luisiana,39.9500869,-75.1683553,Y,11,0

So balayage is all the rage right now and I wanted to change up my hair. I did some Yelping and Ulta did it the cheapest compared to other salons so I thought I'd give it a try. Making an appointment was easy, they have evening and weekend hours. I was set up with Kelly. The salon is conveniently located in Center City, clean and has ceiling/floor windows so you can people watch which is nice. 


Ok, so the fact that none of my close friends can really tell that my hair is different after I paid some decent mula, is a little disappointing. I never said I wanted it to the be super subtle. Obvi balayage is most subtle than ombre/highlights, but it should still be noticeable. It doesn't resemble anything like the pics I showed her. So I feel like my hair is just damaged from the dye but without color... fail. 

I paid $80 with tip (they give 20% for all new clients which is good. They also frequently have random deals, so just look online)",2015,LA,Luisiana,39.9500869,-75.1683553,Y,6,0

So it's your one stop shop for trying new things, picking up a ton of stuff, and comparing whether or not you want to splurge on that oh-so-in fuschia lipstick. Plus they have hair products including shampoo/conditioner/hairspray stuff and also straighteners/brushes/clips.

With regards to drug store brands, they have almost those brands' entire collections so a lot of colors you won't find at the drug store. And fun fact: NYX is super cheap but owned by Urban Decay! 

The first floor is fragrance/skin/high end makeup, basement is drugstore stuff including body lotions and top floor is hair WITH  a salon. Haven't tried it though.. 

So that's all fine and dandy and I can spend hoursss playing around and dropping some serious bank. 

My hesitation for giving a 5 star is because I don't find the people very helpful. When I ask them something they seem to just rave about the product without giving me an honest opinion and more than just ""Yeah it's fabulous!!"" I want to know what other products are similar, the price range, how long it lasts, can you try it on me? I also a little hesitant because a lot of them don't even have their makeup done well..

Pros: 
Jackie was able to give me some input (although it was based off of what she's seen customers buy and not what she's tried herself)

Cons:
They don't carry good body scrubs anymore

She is an esthetian and new alot about ingredients and what not. She probably quit because she new she could work at Sophora. Anyway, I am walking around the store with products falling out of my arms and no one ever offered a bag. Also I am agreeing with another customer about how dusty the products are. For such high end and high prices cosmetics atleast keep them clean! I go in this store frequently and its always the same ordeal. I'm dissatified with the colors I wind up having to go back because I get no help and to top the whole experience off at the end, the girl who rung me up had no idea how to discount the my items correctly.

I wandered the drugstore type cosmetics (Revlon, Covergirl, etc) and while I tested some of the liquid foundations to find my shade, they still didn't seem quite what I was looking for. 

When I made my way over to the center area (where the more pricey cosmetics are, including my fave brand Urban Decay), a salesgirl by the make-up vanity setup asked if I needed help with anything. I told her what I was looking for and she helped me, first showing me tinted moisturizer (which I wasn't a fan of) and then suggested mineral powder foundation.

I decided to try it although I've never really been a mineral makeup kind of gal; however I was pleasantly surprised at the results. First off, it was cheaper than the heavy foundation stuff (which ran $34+ while the powder was $25) and it seemed more natural while still providing coverage.

This was a super experience since she spent at least 10 minutes helping me try everything on to see if I liked how it looked before helping me find one I really liked.

Since I have been going there I've been getting the cut and color that I want without having to ask twice or stomp around angry for weeks because someone messed up my hair. I even had the confidence in my stylist to let her chop off six inches. It should be noted the last time my hair was to my shoulders was about 10 years ago. But I digress..

Though my shopping experience is always unpleasant in that store because everyone working there apparently takes a course in ""how to be rude and alienate your customer base 101,"" I am choosing to focus on my latest visit. 

I'm sorry in advance for the longwindedness of it all.

First of all, the store looks like crap right now. They're remodeling, which is probably a good thing, but it is dusty, the layout is confusing and cluttered and nothing is the same place from visit to visit. Merch has dust all over it, things are habitually out of stock, and signage is worse here than it is at the dollar store.

One of the reasons for my visit was that I was looking for shampoo and conditioner pumps. I buy the massive bottles of Redken - especially when there is a buy 2 get 1 sale (more on that later) because I feel like I'm wasting money if I don't. I also feel like I'm wasting money without a pump because once the bottle is past a certain level of fullness, it becomes a bitch to get out and extends my shower to the point where I throw it out because time = money. I called ahead and asked and they said they sold pumps. I looked online and found multiple makeup alley posts about buying pumps at Ulta. Thought I was safe. I was wrong.

I asked a woman who was wandering the store if she knew where they were. She said she didn't because she was only a skincare specialist (I don't care what your specialty is - you WORK there. Know the layout of your store, it's part your job). She looked around a little and said she would go ask someone to help her. Three minutes later I walk to the middle of the store where the registers are and she's standing there trying to sell a facial to someone.

Not. Cool.

If you didn't find an answer, it's unprofessional enough to just forget that I'm standing back there (with an antsy 2 year old) and start chatting up some old woman who needs more than you can give her, but what I suspect happened..that you purposely left me back there to get some commission might be the most unprofessional way I've been treated in any retail situation - ever. 

I decided right then and there that I was Yelping, but usually when I decide that I end up forgetting. What made me remember was the fact that the 67 year old cashier was rude, gave me dirty looks the entire time she rang up my things and then refused to honor the Redken buy 2 get 1 for two of the products because two were for men (the website EXPRESSLY says that they are included, and I plan to go back and shove the printout in their face, demanding my $20+ back). I asked her about the pumps and she sighed, rolled her eyes and walked away. After 2 minutes or so she came back and said that they don't have any signage for them so they must not sell them anymore. HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS ABOUT YOUR STORE AND PRODUCTS? I seriously don't understand how you can work somewhere and know absolutely nothing about what you carry, where you put it and when you no longer sell it. Sloppy. Unprofessional. Bad business.

To cap off my lovely shopping experience, she didn't ask if I found everything I needed, how I was, thank me for shopping, try to make small talk, ask me if I had an Ulta card (I had to prompt her) or seem like she gave a poop that I am spending my hard earned money in her place of employment, essentially paying her paycheck with my biweekly loyal purchasing.

Guess who just decided to pay someones paycheck at Sephora instead?

I hope management sees this and decides to retrain their staff. There is too much competition in this area (Sephora, namely) to treat customers this way.",2011,AB,Pennsylvania,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,5,0
1675,oeJFLd5z0S0w0CZQmXm7fg,ZsFOwyulu9PMDvA4dtBqsw,1.0,"Only here to comment on the Ulta Nail Service: do NOT waste your money!!!  I went here to try out the OPI gel nails because I had a coupon.  The girl who did my nails was very sweet but she did a HORRIBLE job.  She got the polish all on the sides of my nails and under them and it looked like crap.  Plus the harded polish stuck under my nails felt extremely aggravating until it finally came out a few days later after washing dishes.  It seemed like she wasn't a real nail professional, rather just someone that Ulta sent to the OPI workshop to learn how to apply their product.  

The other really annoying thing was that it cost the same as a manicure ($30) but all she did was paint my nails!  She didn't trim my cuticles, or lotion my hands or anything.  I even asked her to trim my cuticles (they get very dry and I get a lot of hangnails, so that is one of the main reasons I get a manicure) and she said that she wasn't allowed to do that-  HUH?!?!  I will never get a nail service at Ulta again.

If you've never gotten a gel manicure before, here's what you need to know:  Once the gel is hardened you cannot get it off- you have to start over and take the entire layer of nailpolish off that nail.  If you try to pick at a stray piece, you will just end up ripping a chunk out of the gel, which is basically like a plastic coating on your nail; pull a little piece and the whole thing starts to pull off.  Gel is not like regular polish where if they make a mistake and get some on the cuticle they can just scrape it off, even after it's dry.  It has to be applied perfectly and any mistakes must be scraped off while its wet. Once it goes in the UV dryer and hardens, that's it.  

If you're getting gel nails you need to go to someone who's a perfectionist and has a lot of experience.  If you live near Chemical Rd, I suggest Universal Nails, which is next to the Genaurdi's on Butler Pike and Ridge Ave.  Also, the nail salon in Better Health & Tanning on Butler Pike is very good too, but not open on Sundays and Universal is.",2012,AB,Pennsylvania,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,8,0

They carry a good selection of products and high quality brands. Most of my go-to beauty brands are carried by Ulta. Also, the rewards program is pretty good.

Ulta doesn't give samples, which I think is ridiculous, Sephora is very generous with the samples. If i'm considering buying a $40 foundation, I want to be able to try it first and make sure it is going to work for me.

She knew she screwed up and apologized and then added another toner (9) to brighten it which turned it mousey and ashy. So the balayage that I've been working on for months is ruined.

It was too heavy and made my hair incredibly greasy.  Side note: I have lupus, so my hair is already severely compromised and have severe hair loss that I hide with extensions. I mention this, because obviously, its not like just anyone with healthy hair returning a product they ""just don't like.""  The manager refused to give me a refund for the product because ""more than 20% was missing."" THESE ARE TRAVEL BOTTLES. One use of the product is 20%.

I left the products there with my receipt and stated, ""Well, I have no use for this so you can keep it for a sample"" then walked out of the store.

I called Ulta corporate when I got home. The customer service rep stated that it is not part of their return policy that you cannot return a product if 20% or more used.  I received a full refund.

My expectations were too high, I was expecting to walk into a salon that was professional and posh looking. This place is so unwelcoming and would not recommend anyone to go here. 

Let's start with the ambiance, there is nothing on the walls. Each beauty station has the basic oval mirror, chair and supplies. It felt like I was getting a haircut in someone's basement, not a salon, let alone salon whose reputation is based off of being a beauty store. The hair washing station was a mess and awkward; the client view is that of the hair dying tubes. There was nothing on the walls and they are an off white so you got to look at off white walls and a hair dye station. 

My stylist was Melissa and very nice, quite frankly, she should move on from there and find a better salon. She's nice, personable and just an all around nice person but that's not enough for me to go back. The stylist next to her flat out interrupted our conversation to complain about a client but this was after she came back to the wash area to complain how she is only doing hair cuts and will only walk away with $200 that day. I get you want to complain about your job but going to the salon should be relaxing and I shouldn't have to worry about angry blonde girls problems. Oh by the, thank goodness Mike texted you back, I was really concerned.

Lastly, would it hurt you to get some damn hooks for coats? The options were the floor or a chair. Seriously, invest in the $40 for a decent set of hooks to put in front of your crappy hair wash station, at least clients can admire other peoples coats.

Pros: Melissa was awesome and did a great job cutting my hair, decent price for what you get.

Cons: Talking crap on clients and poor ambiance.",2015,AB,Pennsylvania,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,3,0

Basically, if u can do the job that the staff is SUPPOSED to have the ability to do but can't, then ur good to go at this location. 
I always love Ulta, what could be better than a place I can not only get my high end products but also my drug store favorites as well. I can walk in and get my skincare, makeup, and hair care all in one place! 
This Ulta on the other hand always feels like a chore to go to. I go to this location because it's close by and there is a few other stores I like to go into within proximity to it, so convenience is key. BUT before I go I always do research, especially if I'm getting a product I've never used or one that's new to the makeup world. I go in and avoid the customer service staff, or ""experts"" as they like to call them, like the plague. 
One day I came in and got a highlighting product, this product recommended a certain brush. Turned out they were out of the exact brush so I interrupted an ""expert"", who btw was adding another layer of makeup to her already caked face, what alternative would he best for the highlighting product. She acted like she had no idea what highlighter was or what it was used for despite the fact that her face was so highlighted it looked like a unicorn had sneezed on her! Needless to say she was zero help. I won't ask questions again at this location. 
Final thoughts: 
Dear Ulta, when u hire someone as an ""expert"" then make sure they actually fit the definition of that word and that Ringling Brothers isn't their side gig.

I have been getting my brows done relatively consistently for almost 10 years now! That's 10 years in 4 different cities. Nobody has ever come close to giving me brows like Sierra at Seminole Benefit Brow Bar does. 

Sierra in particular is wicked talented at what she does AND she's as kind as could possibly be. She has become one of my favorite people, and to think I only even see her a few times a year. All the Benefit Brow girls here takes the time to consult with you before even touching your skin, to make sure they know exactly the look you want to achieve. They also discusses skin sensitivities/allergies etc... very thoroughly. Before any hair comes off your face they will map out with eyeliner so you know exactly what is going to come off. This means you will never experience the tragedy of leaving a salon with skinny little over waxed brows: AMEN. 

The process is very efficient. If I'm not in too chatty of a mood I can get in and out in under 15 minutes, easily! They also will do your brow makeup and concealer after the treatment, completely complimentary! I usually like to let my skin breathe after a wax and therefore decline this offer but for those instances when I still have reasons to keep my face on it's brilliant! I feel confident carrying out my day knowing that nobody would ever know I just had little hairs ripped off my face.",2020,NV,Nevada,27.8445704,-82.7942125,Y,1,1

1714,qT1-N9hjbyjMW4Mvq4uU4w,QM6CnjtMLVUyOvIj07XFAw,5.0,"Updating this review but this time for The Salon at Ulta. 

Let's play a game of 2 truths and a lie. 

1. I am a natural blonde
2. I do not own a hair straightener 
3. I have never cried in a salon 

Until recently all of these were true. However thanks to the remarkable...sensational...infectiously gregarious...not to mention GORGEOUS, Senior Stylist and Redkin Certified Colorist: Christin. 

For the first time I ~treated~ myself to a real ~salon~ experience. I get the hype and also I don't know if I can live any other way ever again. Christin worked quickly and kept me entertained, which made the fact that I was sitting there for like a bajillion hours less painful (literally). Something I didn't even think about until I experienced it was just how fun it was to be able to peruse and shop while the foils sat in my hair! Ulta is a magical land of glitter and smells and fun, how can you not have an amazing time exploring? 

I got a the double VIP experience, Christin colored, cut, and styled me. And Salon Manager, Bridgette did my wash, massage and blow out. I was facing away from the mirror during my blow out and couldn't see the color result until the end. The oohs and ahs from the gals working as well as my ever doting and loving mother, made me feel like an absolute MOVIE STAR. When she spun me around, it was confirmed: I had movie star hair!!! This is when the tears started. I was crying in a salon. 

This experience was 5 stars and then some. It came at a price and it was lengthy. But it was worth it. It was so worth it. 

I appreciated the attention to detail, the customer care, and the quality of services. I also am thrilled to report that the approach to safety during this time is TOP NOTCH. Masks, gloves, social distancing, it's all happening. 

Do you wanna play another game of 2 truths and a lie?

The scheduling system seems to be non cooperative and many times clients are left out the system. I tried to schedule online and never could the system to acknowledge the appointment. Once I arrived, there was still confusion as to who was going to do my makeup. 

I told Damaris that I wanted fresh, natural, daytime look -- like Joanna Gaines - make up but I don't want to look like I'm wearing make up. I told her to do the best that she could given I have hyperpigmentation. She instantly launched into her story about hyperpigmentation and how she was going to save me.

OKAY -

She pullout every Demologica product in the store and push product. The rep 'just so happened' to be in the store and would not stop pushing  going on and on about the redeeming qualities of the line.  I could feel Damaris compounding more and more make up on me, until the big reveal showed me as if I were going to a red carpet event. When I expressed my distain, the rep said, - I'm paraphrasing here - 'that I'm not comfortable looking beautiful' that's why I didn't like what was done.

EXCUSE ME???

Let's go back to the beginning. I want, 'fresh, natural, daytime - like Joanna Gaines' look. What I got was Red Carpet, with multi shades of eyeshadow that gave me the look of a raccoon.

Originally, I came in to have my Keratin done by another stylist, and it didn't work out. It was an expensive treatment, and Keratins are VERY different from brand to brand, so I think there was confusion on what this particular brand needed to go in successfully, and then there was some misinformation about after care, so of course the Keratin didn't stay in, it washed out right away and looked BAD. I've had Keratin treatments many times before, and knew it wasn't right, so I got in touch with the salon manager and was assigned to Jenna. 
Needless to say, Jenna busted A** to make it right for me. She did a fantastic job and really made sure every step was correctly done, every single step of the way. She made sure I had the right after care products and gave me advice on how to make the Keratin treatment last for the full 90 days, and then some, if I am diligent :) Jenna's super fun and hilarious personality was just icing on the cake. She is awesome and I had a blast hanging out with her while I had the treatment. Jenna will always be my stylists so long as I live in this area.

First round my roots were a hot orange so I had to be reglazed and then 2nd round my roots were an orange brown. She left me like that and charged me $85 on top on the $170 I had paid for the balyage the week before.

Instead of matching my natural root color, they used a lighter color and my roots turned orange and, instead of the white/lightest ash blonde highlights I asked for, they put in dark gray highlights. They also up-charged a couple of treatments without telling me so my bill was well over $200+tip. The 2nd visit: I returned to get everything fixed with a more highly experienced stylist, Sarah. I told her I did not want any of the ""extras"" and that I wanted a highlight that complimented my sparkling, bright white 'grays'. She did a better job than the than the first girl, giving me the root color I asked for, but kept saying, ""I love it when women embrace their natural color."" Ummm, ok. I didn't say I wanted to be gray, just get rid of the brassiness in my highlights, but I didn't think much of it at the time. 
Well, I should've paid attention to that statement the 3rd time I came to get my hair done because Sarah ignored my requests and went for her own vision of me as a gray-haired woman. First, she used foils when I wanted balayage to give a few, strategically placed highlights. The foils added a tremendous amount of highlight in areas I didn't want anymore, and no root color. Next, she used a toner that was darker and grayer than the last so I looked ancient. I was very unhappy and said I never asked to be made a gray-hair. I'm middle-aged but she made me look elderly! Who ever says to their stylist please make me look older!!! 

The coup de gras was they called me and said that since I was unhappy with their work 2 out of 3 times they didn't want me back as a client---say what? Instead of trying to fix the issue they blamed me. They blamed me for their incompetence. The manager never once apologized for what happened or how I was treated. They returned the last money I paid, but kept the tip, which earns them the single star.. 

I went to Sally's right after that phone call and bought everything I needed to fix my hair; roots dyed to the proper color, added a few, balayage highlights, and got a bright white toner and it looks fabulous!

I am an avid beauty shopper and a licensed esthetician with a skincare blog and like to try and test new products but to my dismay every time I looked up from a product I there was the security guard or another employee literally feet away from me staring. It got to the point that when I walked up to the counter no one was there because they were all following me around the store. Alexis the rep who rung me out was walking behind me as I walked to the register and didn't greet me pleasantly when she finally got to the counter. It was as if she or any of the other employees didn't want me there. I do not experience this type of treatment at any other establishment that I shop at. I've literally been to this store twice and have felt uncomfortable every single time. This is a new store so I have them the benefit of the doubt the first time.

The managers name was Catalina Gomez. 
I politely asked the manager, Catalina if she can accommodate me by giving me 10% off on my clarins face masque i wanted to purchase. She disregarded that fact that the item was in filthy and dirty condition and she sold me a dirty looking face clarins after she looked at it and said no to my request. 
So i didn't know that ulta beauty (despite the company name) sold and sells dirty looking items to customers and would not even clean off the packaging at least for me to make me feel like at least she did something about my item i wanted to purchase and helped me out with my experience in the store which she totally didn't even do.

  I called ahead and got an appointment for the same day, which was nice; plus, they were offering a Memorial Day weekend discount for new clients, which was a huge factor in my decision to come to Ulta.  Before I went in, I had long layered hair that went down past the small of my back.  I had been thinking about making a drastic change to short hair for a while (it's hot here!!) and I found several photos of the cut/style I wanted on Pinterest.  That was perfect, because I could bring in my phone, show the stylist all the pictures, and discuss them with her before we started.  I was very excited, and ready for change.  

My stylist was very nice--I believe her name is Rachel--and I enjoyed talking with her about my cut.  The very first thing I said to her when I sat down was that I was ""ready for something edgy--I've been rockin' variations of this same cut for about 10 years.""  That must have been the wrong thing to say.  She forgot the part about wanting to be edgy, and instead (I think) became really intimidated by the amount we were cutting off.  I wanted a steep A-line bob, but instead I got the frumpy bob my mom gave me when I was 12.  As she was blow-drying, she stopped and said, ""you look like you're going to be sick"" and indeed, I wasn't feeling so great.  Instead of an edgy look, I felt like my head resembled a mushroom.  There was barely any difference in length from front to back--there was no other word for it than FRUMPY.   I stayed positive, and had her go back at least 3 times to take more off the back to make the cut more like I wanted.  This was a drastic change, and I knew if I didn't walk out of the salon totally in love with my new look, I'd never convince my husband to like it.  After several attempts at getting my stylist to correct the cut, I finally gave up--I was afraid that we'd reached a threshold where more cutting would just do more damage.  In the end, I ended up with a puffy, uneven bob (the back looks like a kindergardener took a pair of safety scissors and cut off my pony tail) that only looks good if I use a small curling iron to give myself beachy ringlets.  

I thanked my stylist and tipped her because I enjoyed talking to her (she really was very nice) and appreciated her trying over and over again to make the cut right.   In the end, though, the cut is wrong. It looks horrible if I try to blow it out.  And now I am waiting for it to grow out some so I can find a different stylist that can hopefully fix it.   Apparently this salon is just an over-priced Supercuts or Great Clips. I don't think I'll be going back.",2014,FL,Florida,32.4220718,-110.9382766,Y,6,0

Robin, the salon manager, did my hair. I like how you can book a stylist based on experience here. You can get a service slightly cheaper by going with someone with less experience. I think Robin was a mid-level. She was very pleasant to talk to and recommended a conditioning treatment. Why not? My hair could use some rehab. We had a lot to talk about, and I always appreciate when a stylist can carry on a conversation beyond small-talk subjects like the weather.

She styled it a bit messier than I preferred, but after brushing and fluffing it a bit, my hair looked great.

All we wanted was her hair turned under, and told her that my daughters had would not do it without a lot of work and a good amount of product. 

   The stylist could not understand that we wanted the hair smooth with just the bottom turned under, we got up a picture of when it had been done that way before. She proceeded to spray the tiniest amount of heat set in and blow dry it under, while telling my daughter that her hair was cut wrong and she could do this herself easily if her hair was cut correctly- her hair was cut two weeks ago and had lasted all day- So we go to leave and her hair is already popping out. I did not leave a tip.

This is not the first time we have dealt with weird stylists here.

I noticed that the larger woman with short hair who had greeted me at the front door was inconspicuously (I'm sure she was hoping she was) following me from department to department.. first through the make up aisle then the hair section. I actually stopped in the hair section and started asking her about straightening products they offered. She was very helpful with showing me a few items. 

I usually get my hair products from Aveda salons where I get my hair done so I'm actually rather skeptical of anything they had to offer. 

I then started browsing the skin aisles which are on the complete opposite side of the hair section and the larger lady with short hair seemed to find her way there too. I didn't say anything because I had nothing to hide.. but it's a horrible way to feel as a customer. 

I'm actually a licensed esthetician who has worked at Miraval, massage envy and European wax center in the past and am used to much more expensive products than what was offered ULTA.. I was here because I was completely out of face wash and moisturizer at home and instead of ordering my usual products online and waiting for shipping I would just rather go buy something. I had used Clinique as a teenager and my mother sold Lancôme as well and I knew ULTA had SOME of their items. 

I went to pay for my items and low and behold the larger woman followed me there and even had another worker come around from behind the counter while I was paying for my items to see if I had stolen anything there.. like I said I didn't say anything because I had nothing to hide but the entire experience was an embarrassment for everyone involved. 

Now I walked in wearing a $200 coach purse, my $300 lucky brand eye glasses, my Tommy Hilfiger sandals and was not dressed down.. the only  thing I could think of that COULD have made me look suspicious depending on the level of intellect the person had that was judging me, was that I was black. There were plenty of other people walking around the store but I was the only person being followed.

There were about 3-4 employees, and each one asked me if I needed help several times.

When I stopped by to pick up a new lipstain, I learned two things:
- the stain I wanted was discontinued.
- I could only get good advice if I was buying from the premium side of the store. Oh, hello, $30 lip color I don't want. 

The store is divided roughly in half: premium stuff on the left as you walk in and ""budget brands"" on the right. If you are there for a budget brand, I hope you know what you want! There is very little help available for those folks. The stock is deep, deep, deep with a lot of options so you can find just about any product from just about any drugstore brand. 

On the premium side, you can get samples and color tests and hand-holding to walk you through your big purchase. Again, the stock is pretty deep there, too. 

Ulta occupies a niche of ""one step below Sephora, one step above Walgreens"" which works when you know what you want. But to explore, it's probably best to head to Sephora for the first round or go over-the-top and hit up the beauty counters at your favorite department store.

I dropped in here looking for my favorite moisturizer combo: Olay Regenerist serum and Neutrogena moisturizer with retinol. If you want a couple of my beauty secrets, there they are- I use them both together.

Yeah, it's only a few dollars cheaper than a drug store, but that kind of thing adds up.

They also have a really extensive perfume section and you can sample all of the perfumes before you buy them. This is a big deal, especially for someone like me who is obsessed with body sprays and perfumes (it must be the French in me).

I took my bag that had about $80 worth of cosmetics in it and went to check out.  No eye contact, no smile, nothing.  I asked the sales associates before I checked out if there were any more coupons.  Complete silence so I asked again.  No one had an answer until finally one lady tells me there aren't anymore, they were handing them to people outside.  Even when speaking with me no one looked up or acted concerned that I had a question.  I simply put my bag down because at this point no one cared whether I spent $1 or $1000.  I prefer to spend my hard earned money somewhere where at least I get eye contact, a friendly smile or at least acknowledgement.  As I walked out one sales associate said 'Look it up on your phone.  There's a coupon.'  I asked what site and she replied' on your phone.'  Forget it.  I'll drive to the west bank and shop or go to the one on Earhart Blvd.  Or better yet Sephora at Lakeside where they give a damn.",2015,NV,Nevada,29.9407164727,-90.0950057233,Y,3,0

Everything else, you can literally walk out of the door, take a right on the sidewalk and trot your happy ass ten yards down to T. J. Maxx where you can get the same lotion/shampoo/perfume for half the price. 

Best shopping tip: 

(1) Sign up for the rewards points. They add up quickly. 

(2) When the weekly flyer comes, put it in your car immediately. You'll swear you won't need it but you will. Saves an average of $5.00.

(3) If you buy Bed Head, Big Sexy Hair, Sensories Shampoo/Conditioner, any of the holiday store brand lotions, HEMP BRAND LOTION, or any of the fragranced cleansing cloths. Check out T.J. Maxx first. Literally (and I only use that word to say don't be dumb) half price next door.

I ended up going with another drugstore brand eyeshadow that's working out really well. I also tested out about 20 different eyeliners, and settled on an Urban Decay color. BTW, make sure to use their makeup remover at their makeup station so you don't look like a crazy person with lines and makeup all over your hands!

I found most everything I needed besides the specific Rimmel eyeshadow color, and was checked out promptly. My only issue with Ulta is I don't really understand how to utilize their point system, and they never have deals on Bare Minerals which I use religiously for concealer.

I came to pick up gel but the price was a bit much $44 vs $24 on Amazon.  They DON'T price match.  I really want to support brick and mortar stores but that's a huge jump.  I really wanted the product so I picked up the smaller container for $20 thinking I can use the $3.50 coupon (off $15) but of course it's excluded (gotta check the website for excluded brands).

I don't usually get my hair blown dry but I decided I wanted to treat myself because I was going to go out with my friends that night. When I called to set up my appointment, I specifically told the receptionist that I also had tape in extensions and I double checked to make sure if the stylists were comfortable with working with them (if not i wouldn't have gone) and she told me yes and that I was going to be with Brittany (I believe that was her name). I got there and when she took me back to the chair I told her I just wanted it blown out and beachy curls. She said okay and brought me back to the shampoo area and didn't even attempt to make any type of conversation with me at all. It was awkward and I felt uncomfortable. We went back to her station in the front. I sat down and she started to comb my hair through, so i tried to make some type of conversation about my hair extensions. I asked her if the front desk told her I had hair extensions and she told me no. I shrugged it off assuming it was just a mistake. She then began blow drying my hair with an old flat bristle brush that was not even cleaned out from her clients before i'm assuming. It had broken bristles and was full of other peoples hair. She turned my chair away from the mirror the entire time and every time I turned it a little so that I could see my hair she turned me back the other way. After drying it, she started trying to curl my hair with a flat iron to make a body wave...... This entire time (over 2 hours) i was faced away from the mirror in silence and hoping that my hair will turn out okay. At last, she turned my to the mirror after completely frying my expensive hair extensions and i was completely SHOCKED at how ridiculous my hair looked. I took my bill and went to speak to a manager who was unavailable. I grudgingly paid my bill after talking to the front desk (they couldn't do anything about it)....$37 dollars!!!! Like WHAT I could go to a nice salon and pay that amount. I literally looked like George Washington.

I did and I still did not find what I was looking for, so I went back to where the staff was standing around. I asked the same salesperson and her coworker who was standing next to her again.

I made 5:15pm appt online which was convenient and allowed me to choose the price point I desired. I received an email confirmation as well as a phone call to confirm time and price.  In my experience, the prices range by expertise so I chose a $46 stylist from the range of $36, $41, $46, $56. I was also entitled to a 25% discount for the Salon. So far so good.

I checked in, was offered water and took a seat in the small waiting area by the desk. There was hair on the floor.
My stylist came by to tell me she was running behind and that someone would bring me back in 10 minutes or so.  She looked at my hair and asked what I wanted. That was my consultation.

As promised, I was brought into the shampoo area 10 minutes later by another sytlist. I sat, she left.
The floor was dirty...hard to miss since it's white tile. After a few minutes, she came back, barely uttered two words and proceeded to give a really bad shampoo. I could barely feel her hands on my head. She just touched my hair, which is short, so that was quite a feat.  Next came the conditioner, it was rinsed off as fast as it was put on and missed one side of my head. She brought me to a chair in the style station, again without a word and left. The floors in this area needed to be cleaned and swept. There was hair and a comb on the floor beside by chair.  The chairs were dirty and stained.

At 5:30p my stylist appeared, apologized again for the delay and started cutting my hair.  Although the chairs are capable of being raised, she never did that.  She did not take the time and care I expected from an experienced stylist. After a quick cut, she blew dry my hair.  She did not ask how I usually wore or dried it. I was not offered product - odd for a place that sells a boatload of stuff.  My hair looked a little like a helmit when I got in my car at 6pm but it was ok when I washed it this morning. 

All in all, this was a very disappointing experience. Calling this place a ""Salon"" is a stretch and while I could try another stylist, the lack of cleanliness will keep me away.",2014,FL,Florida,39.82605188,-75.54303718,Y,8,0

1949,6GWaqDSEZixrljejinGz4Q,TuMQjYCumnFhWJV2ELwwxQ,1.0,"Well today was a hard day at my local ulta. My mom is gonna be visiting me for Christmas and I came in to try stuff on to get my wishlist together. Back home we only shop at sephora and are both VIB rouge because we love makeup.  My mom loves it, but I'm the real fanatic. I'm an only child. Very spoiled. My mom always indulges this passion of mine.
Which is why I'm so sad by my recent experience because my other experiences have been overwhelmingly good.  It's not good though going into the busiest time of year in terms of sales for a retailer to get it SO wrong.
I had found some brushes. I asked to see the testers of them so I could feel them. I was the most interested in an ""it cosmetic"" brush for cream and powder.  I have a Chanel silicon based cream bronzer that I want to use it with.  Right now it's my Laura mercier brush from when I freelanced, it's more than 10 years old but in great shape. I really just wanted something to throw in my crazy purse that would stay nice and was small.  Anyways, I was refused the option of feeling the limited edition holiday brush by it cosmetics . Instead she tried to talk down to me and tell me about the product in order to sell it after I repeated to her, I was not going to buy a brush I can't feel first. Is that really that crazy? As a veteran makeup artist, I'm not gonna know I love the brush until I feel it and fluff it. I don't need to use it I just wanted to fan it to feel the density of the bristles. I know exactly what I'm looking for, but I need to feel it.  The whole premise and success of a store like ulta and/sephora is this experience. Try before you buy. I'm so easy, I have a list in mind of what I want before I even get in the store. I clean up after myself. And I use testers hygienically. All I asked for was to feel a tester.
Because I was unhappy with her she then made a point to interrupt me multiple times while I was trying on makeup. I wasn't using the brushes and she took them away. Then when I needed a brush there was no associate around, so I cleaned a brush and used it. Then another associate came over to take the brush away rather than offer assistance to apply the becca compact. She came simply stated the brush was for employees and walked away.... okay if that's store policy I understand. But how was I supposed to try on the powder compact she interrupted me using-face half done? I'm baffled by the lack of customer service because I contradicted this power hungry manager.
She was in a dear santa sweater and I'm pretty sure she called herself the creative director. Honestly, if she is in a leadership position I fear you are losing business.  
In terms of how to train your employees better it seems pretty simple.  If they legitimately do not have the ability to make a tester of the brush or it didn't send one, explain that... don't just say no. It's too much because I KNOW ""it cosmetics"" would be appalled by her behavior.  
And the other associate, I assume acting under her direction to make me feel bad about using a brush they didn't feel was appropriate is a reflection on your stores lack of leadership and customer service training.
If I'm gonna spend a few hundred dollars and my mom easily double that in any given visit to a beauty store, we expect a lot more.  There are three ulta stores in town, the Mae Anne location is next to the dog park and was my favorite. Sephora is in south Reno, so I almost always go to ulta first.  Now, I'm considering making the drive to sephora or trying a different ulta.
I hope this is helpful from a training perspective.",2017,PA,Pensilvania,39.52978792,-119.8662468,Y,12,0

In fact, most makeup counters salespeople go overboard to have you sample the products. I never was treated so shabbily in my life at a makeup counter! 
Of course when i spoke up about this to the manager the salesperson then applied some makeup samples on my face but by then i had lost my enthusiasm for buying at that location.

I have a love hate relationship with this place. One of the stylist/managers picks and chooses what she wants to do and does not do up-dos. I booked Sandra for the Air Force ball because she was good the two times I had her. But when she didn't want to do the updo I needed and passed me off to someone else. Turns out she does this often. There has also been times when I booked another girl and without calling she switched my apts from the girl I booked for color to her. I understand the girls have things come up but to do that without calling. Anyways thank goodness for Kiana (that was the first time she was my life saver). Frankly if someone books you for an updo and you can't or won't do updos you shouldn't be in this line of work. That night I also noticed the way she treated the other stylists and even customers. I thought she was nice up until that night. I also think some of the younger stylists put up with more than They should. I was in the military and we were treated better than the way she treats them. It's easy to notice when you watch the eyes (she glared a lot and acted holier than thou) her interaction, tones, and body language said it all. Twice now I have had an apt and they were overbooked or surprise the girl I booked was MIA. They said they called but I looked and I had no missed calls and even showed the stylist my phone call history. 

I waited for Kiana because she's worth the wait. Online it books for 2 hours but only takes about 1 hour max for color. Bless her heart. She is super good and I hope she finds a better place to work that appreciates her along with some of the other girls. If I had to work under those conditions I would have found another place to work. Some of the girls are great but the manager  needs to get it together! Kiana 5 stars and the manager and salon manager 1 Star. I can't remember her name but there is a young stylist with dark hair and nose ring who is also good. She cut my hair once and I really like it. I keep coming back because of the few stylists I like but it's getting to the point where I can't stand how the business is run nor the way the managers treat the girls and with them not calling when there is a
Mishap. 

*****From what happened today and realizing I'm not the only one who was not contacted ....there were 2 other girls that came in claiming they were not contacted so I know damn well this manager and stylists didn't call and it confirmed the issues here. But yet the manager gets pissy if you can't make an apt.

*I would also price check products (the ceramic brushes can be found on amazon for over $10 less and most of the products I have found a lot cheaper on amazon) and services. It's around 40-50 just for a hair cut. I paid over 200 for a color that included highlights and a trim. I think the color is worth it but a trim costs too much here.",2018,TN,Tennessee,32.2052740942,-110.7870014684,Y,6,1

Hands down worst salon experience ever and I would literally rather do anything but a repeat of my interactions with the rude stylists. They talked to me like I was ignorant, kept talking to me like a child, saying ""right?"" after every sentence... told me initially that they wouldn't be able to complete the hair color I wanted in the three hour time slot. Okay, that's fine. I asked what else we could do, they said an all over color. Two mins later I was told there wasn't enough time for that. It was 6:20 and they are there until 9.

Joy just flat out did not want to help me and she literally knocked her arm into my shoulder and didn't even apologize. Not sure about you, but if I bump into a stranger on the street I'm apologizing. Why didn't I get the same courtesy as a client in her salon chair! It's because she didn't want to help me. She didn't talk to me at all, she didn't offer to show me my hair cut. Just handed me the barcode to pay and that's it. She kept making faces at the stylist next to her also. I thought I was at Ulta not in middle school. 

People generally leave a salon feeling better about themselves and having an enjoyable experience. That was not the case. I even confronted her about how she was treating me, both her and the mid 60s blonde lady. They kept throwing prices out there like it was an issue. Why would I have been there if I couldn't afford it? Both of them were offensive and should reevaluate whether or not they can provide the utmost level of respect and courtesy to their clients. Neither of them can. 

The point here is to stay far away from Joy. She will make sure you know she's better than you and that your presence in her salon chair is a bother to her. She will also tell you that she works two jobs and ""understands"" what it's like. Hahahaha I bet because she gets no tips at Ulta BECAUSE SHE IS TERRIBLE.

I had a hair appointment (first time in salon) which went pretty well. The stylist was sweet and suggested some product that she thought would help so I agreed. They were having a buy 2 get 1 free special and the stylist said they didn't have one of the products in stock. I told her that I wanted to take advantage of the special and she told me no problem, I could mix/match products and she handed me the 3rd product. 
When I went to check out is when my experience went downhill. 
The ""prestige manager"" was the person who checked me out. She interrupted my transaction twice to help others/and look for something and at no point did she excuse herself. When she gave me the total I asked her if she gave me the Ulta promotion that was going on as I bought $40 worth of Ulta. She looked in my bag, questioned if I had purchased enough and then said, "" oh okay, what color do you want?"" I told her and she took out the receipt, did something , and then I was done. I thought the total seemed a little high but I waited until home to check. When I got home I noticed I had something in my bag that wasn't mine, AND she hadn't given me the discount on the hair products. 
I grabbed the random product, receipt, and headed back to the store. She never apologized, she just ""returned"" a product that she had put in my bag (while helping other people) then proceeds to tell me that the hair product doesn't qualify for the discount. When I told her that her employee told me /sold me on it she stated there was nothing she could do. Flat out zero other than I could return all the products. Epic fail Ms Prestige Manager. A simple ""I'm sorry for the incorrect info and I'm sorry that you had to drive her a second time because WE made a mistake ""would have gone a long way.

The properties and so on and so forth. 

Originally, we were scheduled for a hair appointment.  It  did not go as well as it could have and we did not have the best experience.

She said it does not look that bad on camera.. um try looking at it in person!  Now I have to go to a corporate party looking like a flipping clown! I have a $800 credit card with this company and I will cut up this card and never return! Stay away if u like your hair!! They will ruin it!  My scalp feels like it's burning still.

I have curly hair and made an appointment online to get it straightened. I texted the stylist a picture of my hair blown out to tell her that's how I would be coming in. She moved my appointment to the last slot of the day because she said it would take too long and she didn't want to mess up the schedules. I felt like that was disrespectful of my time, and made me feel like a burden that had to moved to the last possible slot to accommodate them.

The second appointment I made to get my hair straightened again (one week later), they let me know up front that it would be $65 instead of the usual $30 because my service was actually a ""silk press."" I don't think they even know the definition of a silk press, as I was coming in with my hair ALREADY blown out. When I questioned the price increase, they told me that they just changed their policy in the LAST week. To top it off, when I didn't respond for 15h because I was working a night shift, she had the audacity to say she was cancelling my appointment. Even though the appointment was scheduled a week-and-a-half in advance and there was no urgency to receive confirmation from me. This stylist's name was Kristen S. I recommend avoiding her if you can. She was incredibly unprofessional and hostile, attempting to instigate an argument with me over text. She must have a lot of time on her hands. Clearly business is slow.

The stylists do a decent job on your hair, but it comes at the cost of feeling marginalized and discriminated against for having a hair texture different than theirs. I would strongly recommend anyone with curly or textured hair to take their money elsewhere. There are many other salons to go where you will feel respected.
