They said it excluded the brand I was purchasing... however, the fine print didn’t exclude it. Then they said I didn’t even have the right status to be getting that coupon... They also said I needed to buy more to get the coupon to work which was not true. After being told no more than 3 times, they finally scanned it (something they should’ve done from the get-go) and it worked. Manager was not nice and actually seemed upset when it worked. The whole ordeal was embarrassing and took up time, which was not necessary.

I wanted to leave a new review bc I have been particularly impressed at how great you ALL have performed during these difficult days we are in, due to Covid-19. Shopping in-store, I do feel safe as is possible, so I do appreciate y'all for putting in so much extra work and effort- IT SHOWS! THANK YOU for being there when many other stores didn't even try to open in the beginning of the ""reopen stage."" (and YES, I understand why some did not- no issue with that)
Playing around with makeup is an outlet for me because I'm already stuck in the house 95% of the time anyway, due to an illness. So I am EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE that you all have chosen to come (back) to work. The curbside pick-up option has been such a great thing to do.

Now, instead of an actual men's section where you can go to pick out what you want and only have to hunt an associate if you can't find what you need, everything is scattered all over the store, seemingly to hide that they've removed over half their men's care products. Out of the 5 or 6 products I would regularly buy in there, they now carry zero. If you're an introvert that just likes to be able to grab what you need and leave, this is definitely no longer the store for you. The layout now seems to be set up to force you to ask for help. At least I still have Amazon. Millennials aren't killing stores, poor layout design and poor customer experiences are. This shop is dead proof of that.",,,0x8888a833c3af13fd:0x343c3567897354e5

Not one of them greeted me said ""Hello welcome to Ulta"" or asked if I needed help or anything they all were very smug and continued there conversations. This location has to be the most dirty Ulta that I have ever been in. ALL testers were filthy and not wiped down, the inside and outside of the pallets are just nasty smashed ,crushed and messed over. The outside of the pallets have all kinds of mess on them obviously they dont maintain them. Also a lot of the pallets were not even properly attached to the display  barley touching it it fell off... touch the pallet next to it.. they both fall off.. especially in the Tart cosmetics section it was a mess. All of the lip sticks were smashed and running down the jar it did not look sanitary or properly maintained. If you did take a sample or a swotch of a color there were no wipes to clean your hands ex.. the clean up sections were not properly stocked. The isles were unorganized and had products on the floor in the hair care area. Make up storage boxed that are $60 + strung out on the floor with brushes and what not. The entire time I was in the store not one employee greeted or asked if I needed help finding anything they were very unwelcoming and uninviting and had a dont bother me vibe.  I will not be returning to this location of Ulta beauty.  I go to the location in River chase and theres is perfect friendly, clean and welcoming so I know what to expect from the franchise.  Midtown village location is not hitting the mark. Also the store needs a good airing out because the perfume testing smells were so over powering it hit me like a truck the second I entered the store. It was distracting and over whelming how it felt stuffy as if there is no air circulation in the store and smelled of stale perfume samples all mixed together with thick air. Which the other Ulta locations I have visited do not have this problem. The store did  not have a clean sleek environment that Ulta is known for. Non of the products were properly fronted on the shelf for easy and clear access. I had to keep checking to make sure the correct pallet was sitting in the proper spot and most of the time they were not. Everything was jumbled around not in its proper place not properly fronted for easy viewing. At the end of it all the store was such a mess I just left. Will not return to this Ulta.",,"{'text': ""We're sorry to hear that you were disappointed by your visit with us. We're always looking to improve our services, so we appreciate your honest feedback.

There items were ulta beauty items so nothing that should have been hard to find. Instead of the employee trying to help me find the item she asked me if I needed help but in a confrontational way, like the thought I was stealing. I was taken back by the attitude so I told her no, that they did not seem to have what I needed. As I kept looking through the store she purposely inserted herself in my way, walking in between me and the item I was looking at, talking to someone standing on the other side of me. I left without buying anything since I felt so berated by the employee.i might never go back. *Note went to saphora after and was helped by a great employee and got everything I needed.

I signed up and received a magazine for each.  After said month I had a charge on my account for Glamour magazine where they had automatically debited my account.  I called Glamour who refunded my amount and stopped the subscription.  I told them I had never given them my credit card, and how did they have my card number.  The rep advised me when I signed up for my free month that Ulta transferred my credit card number over (which they failed to clarify) and it was something I authorized when signing up.

Michael was personable and I enjoyed talking with him while he cut my hair. Jennifer was the other stylist there and the atmosphere was relaxed. I had a 10:30 am appointment and was done at 11:30.

She did not ask if I wanted it curled and just went ahead and did it and charged me for it. Imagine my surprise when I got the bill for a $70 haircut. It came off to me as very unprofessional and I didn't appreciate the lack of transparency and lack of communication. Every other salon I've been to communicates when a service costs extra and asks before doing anything that would be an additional cost.

It was my first time ever having salon services done at ULTA, and I am beyond thrilled with the results! Nicole was my stylist (she's listed as Jacqueline if you make an appointment online), and she was AMAZING!! She did a very thorough consultation with me before we started to determine the look I was wanting and map out the best way to achieve it. She explained different processes and their end results to me, and knowledgeably answered the questions I asked. We ended up going with all-over color, full highlights, and the haircut/deep conditioner/style combo. She was extremely professional and obviously very confident in her skills which allowed me to relax and fully enjoy the whole salon experience. The services I had done take a few hours, but Nicole was so engaging and attentive that the time just flew by! And the finished product was simply breathtaking, no exaggeration. So I absolutely, 100% recommend The Salon at ULTA Beauty; the stylists there are all clearly top notch. But if Nicole is available, do yourself a huge favor and book with her.

My friend told me that she loved going their so I set up an appointment online for a cut and style with Monah. When I got there the lady at the register said she was running behind and would page me when she was ready. I heard my name called so I went to the front desk. But I think the lady was on her way out so she just told me to have a set in a chair. Their was hair still all over the floor from the last person but she still had me sit there. Mohan washed my hair and started the hair cut. She didn't talk much and disnt ask if the cut in the back was to short. ""It was"" she straightened my hair to finnishe the cut. She didnt really style it at all. When I got to the register to pay she said it would be 66. But online it said 55. And their was a sign that said 1st time customers get 20% off there hair cut. But she said straightening my hair cost extra. But no one told me that. She never said anything. So she called a manager up. But the hair salon manger left for the day. So this lady had no idea what was going on. Monah took off the 11 is cost to straighten my hair and told me that someone should have told me before the hair cut that it was extra. She didnt give me 20% off and acted like she did me a favor by taking off the 11 dollars. It was just a bad experience. I will not go back there.",,,0x56c8942452d84811:0xe5c4b11a9df014e6

After a few minutes of looking at the colourpop stuff one of the employees literally yells at another lady for touching the display makeup. Like just all the sudden yelling. Literally startled me it was so quiet and all you here is a banshee yelling at this poor lady just because she has to clean a few makeup items. Other service workers like myself have to clean a lot more than you boo. After my first trip I actually had to come back in because I forgot moisturizer. So I go to the Clinique stuff and there’s a box of different stuff. The TAG says suggested retail price is 39.30. But the price on the SHELF said 22 dollars. The lady working there would not believe me nor would she honor that price even tho there was more than one box there it’s not like they were put in the wrong spot. So point is the female employees like to scream like banshees at customers and then argue with them and not honor their prices. I hope ulta hires better employees or learns to train them better.,,"{'text': ""Hi Kayla, we're very sorry to hear about your visit.

She was a bit condescending and hard to deal with. I was already having a bad day and decided to stop by an Ulta to cheer myself up. It didn't help that she could not find my Ulta account when I was checking out, especially when I already have an unlta credit card. She wanted to update my information so badly and I really wanted to check out already, pay and leave because u couldn't handle it anymore. Her name was Sylvia and she really needs to be trained on her customer service skills. I went back inside the store because she forgot to ask me if I wanted to redeem any points with my purchase , but I had another employee help me because I could not stand the idea of Sylvia helping me with my purchase.",,,0x872a6ff6df7e31db:0x702113bb22fc19c2

Never had a bad expirence here! Been going here more than Sephora you can tell the difference when you visit both stores.
Kat Von D is my only reason to go to Sephora. They don't ever restock on her products so I just stick to getting her products online.

I took her to Nordstrom in Chandler, and they were more than happy to seek her out and offer WONDERFUL customer service (the store was even busy, but they still made customer service a very high priority), and we were happy to pay for it.

That will not stop me i will find what I need and they cant bring me down. I'd rather be me than to be like that. Great places do wonders for people  I just need to search.

I felt bad so I asked  a question about a straighter. She answered my question, but then said I ""had to have heat protectant"" and showed me a bottle- fine I'll try it even though I told her I hate heat spray. While I am standing there she asks if I need sunscreen, and if my husband needed a Father's Day present. Then she wanted me to sign up for a credit card.

Not trying to bash on the other locations but the customer service overall is much better than others I've visited. The staff was all very nice and welcoming, I was able to get expert advice on hair and make-up products with the help of their Master Stylist, Heather, who was an absolute doll to work with. She was very welcoming, bubbly, honest and kind. I appreciated that she didn't judge what I needed based on how I looked. Money is never an option for me and sometimes I don't dress to impress so I appreciate not being treated like I'm afraid to spend money.

I also liked that I was asked by at least 3 other gals, all of whom were doing something while asking if I needed any assistance and all looked ready to jump at the opportunity. All the ladies I talked to knew where the product was, didn't seem bothered by my questions, and were oh so ready to help me out. The store was very clean and organized, and all the ladies working this morning seemed to be in very good moods. I loved how active they were on the floor, most other locations I frequent, its almost impossible to find someone to help you out and when you do they almost always seem annoyed or bothered. So this location won 5 stars for me because of the people the hiring manager decided to hire.

Amazing products at competitive prices and quality people!",,,0x876c6c4493d4fc1f:0xda60de8fd444ca75

Luckily, there was a fantastic esthetician working in the salon because no one was scheduled to work the brow bar for the day. Got a quick wax and grabbed a few other products. When I went to check out my email coupons wouldn’t pull up and the cashier wouldn’t honor the coupon I was showing her. All she could say was “yeah, we have horrible service here.” Make sure to print out your coupons before hand or have them saved to your phone.

The only reason why this review got 3 stars is because of the esthetician working in the salon. I was not greeted when walking in and never asked if I needed help while looking at other products. Employees seemed more interested in talking to each other.",,,0x876c6c4493d4fc1f:0xda60de8fd444ca75

1.119018738207473e+20,Mostly Anthologies,1527798154530,2,"Stood in line still after waiting 15 minutes of ""extra shopping"" while I saw one lady checking out a line of customers and I kept my eye open for when it moved before standing there ... With bp issues associated with Lupus, it is not good for me to stand still for long periods, or it causes fainting.  It has happened.  So I keep my legs moving while waiting and watching floor sales just wander around pretending they did not see the line of customers waiting.  I finally got in line and waited another 15 minutes behind the same girl I was behind when I decided to move my legs a bit.  That's right.  She hadn't moved an inch.  Customers talking to the only checker we're not helping her out, I'm sure.  She was the ONLY worker I saw actually working.  I absolutely felt bad for her.  Finally a second lady (who pretended to be surprised, or maybe she was, since all workers were just messing around in the store gabbing with each other, so maybe she was geniunely surprised to see there was an actual line and no extra checkers.  She offered to check me out, and I thanked her because she was the only one to offer to help the initial checker.  The fact that they were the only store in Brighton to carry eyebrow shaper as well as ONE highlight kit, I had no choice but to wait it out which I am fairly patient but that was completely avoidable to not have a 30 minute wait with what I counted as 4 employees doing nothing while 2 checked customers out, one coming a half an hour into the wait.  I wish customer service still existed.  Sadly it's a thing of the past.  I like Ulta but the employees seem like they do not care about your time or your comfort in the insanely lengthy lines.
Edited to add: I agree with other customer reviews about them following you around.  It feels like being stalked.  I don't know if it's a ""steal"" thing like some have considered, but like they make commission or something and just harrass you.  Today, I did not have that issue on the floor as they were busy yapping gossip with each other.  Which I'd rather them gossip than harass me while I shop.  But it's funny that they give so much attention on the floor and then completely ignore you in the checkout lines.",,,0x876c6c4493d4fc1f:0xda60de8fd444ca75

They have a lot of products here, a small salon too. The displays were eye catching and the smells from the different fragrances was nice ( but if strong smells are over powering ,maybe not the place to shop).
It gets pretty crowded in here but worth coming in here and getting something for a friend, family or even yourself.

1.1833148144085407e+20,Marci DeCarlo,1557338462299,2,"Went to this location today for a hair cut. The stylist, Iris, was super quiet during the whole appointment. I don’t know much about hair, so I showed her 3 pics of what I wanted (two were of me from a few years ago) which was to cut off the split ends, remove length, and have side swept bangs.

There were a few times where there was a phone call or someone at the desk, which I know she had to address, but she didn’t even say anything, just kind of walked away each time.

She ended up not touching my bangs at all, even though they were crazy long, and didn’t style a side swept bang at all. Also, she didn’t cut much length off. (When she said I was “all done” I had her fix those issues, though)

She asked if I wanted my hair flat ironed, and I said sure! As I was paying at the front I realized that she charged me for it. She never told me if it would be any cost, just asked if I wanted it.

The woman at the front desk (a manager, I think) was very apologetic, and gave me a sample face cream for the flat iron issue.

I can’t say this is the best haircut I’ve ever had. It was ok, in the end. She ended up thinning my already somewhat thin hair out, which sucks.

I’ve been to the north haven one before, though, and had no problems. I probably won’t be coming back to this Ulta, which sucks because it’s much closer to where I live now.",,,0x89e7ca02be0dbcf9:0x6ed41a5b33f76942

Store was fairly tidy but stocking employees had some areas blocked when I was there. A comment about Ulta in general is their heavy push to register for their rewards program which holds up the line at the register. Ulta generally doesn't do a good job of staffing the registers and I always have to wait. I never have to wait at Sephora and Sephora always gives samples while Ulta never does. Ulta's selection of Philosophy,  one of my favorite brands, is lacking in variety.  However I do like how many brands of items they carry. This Ults store also had a limited nail polish offering compared to other Ultas I've visited.",,,0x89e7c103b44769df:0x654ac80919fd6c09

No greeting when I walked in, I had to interrupt employee side conversations, twice to ask for help with items I had planned to purchase.  And once I did that it was like I was a bother to them.  I asked for a perfume tester, since there wasn't one on display and I was told that she would check and come find me, she never came back.  Then I got to the register, where the same employee was having a side conversation with other employees and she saw me and said, oh I never got back to you! But still didn't follow up on my request.  At this point I was already frustrated so I paid for what I needed and left.  I'd like to add that the store was not at all busy, especially for a Saturday afternoon. There seemed to be too many employees with nothing to do and lots of unstocked shelves...

I was excited that this Ulta was opening so close to where I live, but honestly I'd rather drive to Manchester or Plainville for the sake of better customer service.

Edited to say that I've worked in customer service for 11+ years, I'm pretty confident in saying that I know a thing or two about treating customers fairly and with respect.",,"{'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience regarding this visit, Rae.

I went to the registers to pay and 2 employees behind the counter were trying to sign up a women and possibly her daughters for a free makeover info session happening on an upcoming weekend. She declined and the same 2 employees then rang out and pitched the same offer to the woman in front of me. She decided to take the offer so 1 of the employees came around the counter with a clip board to get her scheduled. Now with no sense of urgency to take care of me, the second employee taped up a few items to put on hold for the woman scheduling the appointment.  Neither employee ever looked up at me to say, good morning, we will be right with you, nothing. I was just about to leave my purchase on the counter when she decided to take care of me. The first employee finishing up the scheduling.  Now I'm paying for my purchase, the 2 employees are chatting, I have a coupon that does not apply to my purchase,  it is a chore for her to explain why I cannot use it, I further annoy the cashier Tara's by using my Ulta card, no customer service, I take my purchase and leave.  No offer of a free makeover session for me. The last woman was encouraged to bring a friend. What triggers them to only offer to ""certain"" customers. I'm pretty sure I spent more money then the two woman in front of me combined. Was it because I wasn't wearing makeup on this morning, so they assumed I don't wear makeup? Was I not dressed properly because I already worked 8 hours in one of my 3 restaurants? I usually shop on line due to my busy schedule but this morning I decide to go in and get the worst guest experience ever. When my schedule allows I will make the time to return my purchase and spend my hard earned money elsewhere. Maybe a little team development on not to always judge a book by it's cover. I waited 5 days since this experience hoping my feeling would change but it hasn't.  I hope no one who visits my business ever walks away feeling they did not receive the same service as the guest in front of them.

One sales associate was assigned for the Clinique department only. The other sales associate was with a client so I waited patiently while trying on some of the Too Faced cosmetic items until she was done with that customer. She walked past me and asked the woman who was behind me if she needed help. This lady came in the store well after I had been waiting for 10 minutes. I decided to not make a purchase and as I was leaving, the manager was at the front of the store speaking with another sales associate and I turned around and told her of my experience. I had no idea she was the manager.  She was polite and I explained to her the situation and asked her is that the way to treat all customers? Or was her associate intimidated to ask me if I needed help for whatever reason? She said passively, no I don't think she was intimidated to ask you. I said well, I have no other idea as to why she avoided to extend her help. Being a platinum member, I would hope that every customer feels welcomed to be in the establishment that they frequent regularly.  The Ulta location in Westport is much more welcoming and appealing.

Then when I said it’s hard to believe that they can’t recommend another clear brow gel from another brand they said well yeah of course if I knew that’s what that product was. And that was coming from an associate and manager both not having an answer. I’d say it’s pretty embarrassing the store manager and 2 associates of a makeup store aren’t knowledgeable of the products they carry in store (especially since the purpose of the product is self explanatory in the name and is described on the shelves where they stock it) I’ll stick with Sephora.,,"{'text': 'Hi there.

I was there for 6 hours
SIX HOURS!!!
I left with a whole different look. I didnt get the hair cut I wanted. Or the color I wanted and was told that I'm a ""tough case"" because of the color I had on my head previously.
I felt like she did what she wanted. She rinsed my hair in the sink and after rinsing she applied more bleach and toner. My roots ended up almost white. The rest did not. I'm just so upset. I've had my husband dye my hair at home with box bleach and ended up with the colors I wanted in 45 minutes, today I was there six hours with no happy ending.

The rewards programs is pretty generous. There are so many high-end brands and they have them where you can sample if you'd like. Love, love, love that Urban Decay!

The typical drugstore brands are here as well - and they have GREAT sales on them. The Jumbo Sales are the best and you can save plenty waiting for them.

I can't speak to the salon services. But the Brow Bar service is perfect, every time.",,,0x8890c011574c2c31:0x2f2089b26c7aa75d

Many genres of beauty supplies here but some things were not in same location, like nail polishes/supplies. Associate did go back and forth twice to check sale prices and then again to bring me a shopping bag; EXCELLENT SERVICE. Would be nice to have testers for temporary hair coloring sprays and chalks. After completing my purchase and leaving, I saw my points listing on receipt along with expiration date for some points. Being new to the points program, I called customer service.

Make up items disorganized. Remember those little plastic hand held mazes with tiny metals balls and you had to tilt it in every which way to make it through the maze down to the bottom? That's what it's like trying to find something there. Just a strange place to me. I think the one major thing they have going for them is that they are not in the mall. I usually go to Dillards.

1.1362396752918048e+20,Denise Loughrey,1549467846496,2,"Possibly the worst Ulta store I have ever ""tried"" to shop in - from day one. Consistently bare shelves, especially if it's a sale item. Largely rude employees with little product knowledge or any cosmetic experience. My daughter was ""color matched"" twice in one day by two different employees, who came up with two different results. Neither actually matched her skin. Make sure you download any coupons or your customer profile BEFORE you arrive if you'll want to use them to make a purchase - assuming whatever you'd like to buy is actually in stock. Literally, ZERO internet service, which began late summer (2018), but got worse around Black Friday when the minute both my daughter and I entered the store my phone cell signal strength went to zero and my phone was,  ""searching for service."" It was almost like there was a signal jammer in the store. I heard several customers complaining about the same thing. When I asked an employee about it, I was told it was because of the roof on the shopping center blocks cell service, which makes no sense, as my phone works great when I am in the stores on either side - but like I said, my phone worked great in the store until a few months ago. Not to mention, it's literally the same strip center, with the same roof and my phone/internet is fine in every other store in that same shopping center.

No customer service at this store. Not one single staff member would acknowledge me or even bothered greeting me. Brushes on shelf were not stocked and I could not get anyone to assist me or check for inventory or to even see if I could maybe order for pickup another day if something wasn't in stock. The store was not busy and the staff was only interested in talking amongst themselves and another girl ignored me when I asked if she could help and looked annoyed because she was busy texting on her phone.

1.0685855846992685e+20,Damein Turner,1535978292382,1,"Undervalued, mislead, and judged is how I'd summarize my first experience with Ulta.

I called to ask if they had anyone who specialized in natural African American hairstyling.  My daughter wanted to cut her hair short and style it. I was assured that yes this could be done and an appointment was booked at 6:15 on Friday. We are understanding, so when we received a call asking if the appointment could be pushed back an hour we agreed to it. We arrived early for the new time and the stylist and I both agreed in order to do it right, it wasn't worth starting on it that night as the store closed at 9.

The new appointment was Sunday at 11. We arrive and show the stylist a couple of styles that we would like. We ask for the stylist's expertise on which one was doable and I asked again was she sure before she started cutting my daughter's hair. The stylist chose a style and started cutting.  Two hours into the cutting I step outside for some fresh air. I'm texted to comeback inside because the stylist was done.  To my surprise, no styling was done and the cut didn't seem right for the style she chose.  The reason I was given was that she didn't have the time. I was told to comeback in 5 weeks and that she the stylist, books up fast.

I have a few questions and will be reaching out to the corporate office in Illinois, Mary the CEO, and possibly share our experiences on several social media platforms.

Questions:

Why was our appointment pushed back an hour but there wasn't an attempt to ask the next customer for a little more time ?
Why weren't we told that it may not be finished ahead of time so we could make a decision ?
What happened to all the talk about showing us products that was going to be used on her hair that we could purchase to maintain her hair ?  No product was used and no assistance was offered.
Why during the cutting I was constantly reminded that it would be extra but never given a price or a sense of wanting to perform what was needed ?  I was okay with it all.  Maybe the stylist somehow knew what I could afford ?

I still payed for the service, not knowing if I received the 20% discount promised for first time customers. My daughter was heart broken but didn't want to cause any trouble. Ulta taught my daughter and I a valuable lesson.",,,0x8890c011574c2c31:0x2f2089b26c7aa75d

They looked down on us when we walked in maybe because I just got out of the shower and was wearing 0 makeup.

She looked at him and said what brand? And he said he knows it as Lanolin. Then she looked at her coworker as if my husband was stupid and said “do you know that brand?” And the other girl said yes Lanolips and showed him where it was.

And a lot of the time you are lucky if there is even half of the testers available to swatch. Which makes it very hard to choose a perfect shade of foundation. After spending over a $100 with my bag in hand, I asked politely for a small sample of foundation that I was interested in purchasing on my next visit. But I was rudely told that they don't give out samples at ulta. I can understand that some people just want freebies, but I had the proof in my bag that I was a paying and regular customer (platinum).

My first time out of the United States in a while. I did keep three amazing products that were really great and the girl that sold them to me was incredible and amazing. Unfortunately when I tried to return them not only were there three of them behind the register doing nothing the girl that took the return seemed very upset that I was returning a lot, even though they had said because of pandemic they weren't we weren't allowed to try on anything she kept asking me every single time did I use them or whatever while she was opening them and looking at them she was saying and the other two girls behind her didn't make any change about that either. She wasn't dressed very professionally her fingernails were filthy and definitely has an attitude that shouldn't be working at the register. I was a retail manager for 44 years with 60 employees sometimes and I know this is not the type of visit that you want to have from a client.

I wanted hair extensions and make-up. Easy enough right? Wrong! Not at this location!! First off there was only one person working the salon I sat there for 20 minutes only to be told the girl isn't there. So I didn't even get any information. Next I went  go and get my Clinique. I stood there for another 20 minutes and no one helped me. I wandered around until I found help and the woman was really sweet but refused to even go to Clinique and was insistent on selling me Torte. It's a great product,  just not what I wanted. Needless to say, I left empty handed. I've scheduled my hair elsewhere and probably be going to Sephora for my make-up.

This was for my wedding and i wasted a week of time that i could have used to find someone else.   I will never go to an ultaa salon I will never buy another product from ulta and I will never ever have a good word to say about them.

I cannot think of one time that I've had a pleasant experience at this Ulta. Every single time I am confronted with snobbish glares from employees, rude and not helpful workers, unclean makeup products, and now misinformation. Two weeks ago, I was picking a few things up for a trip I was going on (eyebrow pencil, new highlighter, et cetera) and I was checked out by a woman with red and green hair. The whole time she was ringing in my orders, she was talking to customers at the next register paying NO attention to me. Now I'm not saying ""boohoo pay attention to me"" I'm saying that I had a question that I had to stand there for two minutes after she handed me the receipt to ask. My question was ""when is the next shipment of the Too Faced Sweet Peach palettes coming?"", she then seemed annoyed and told me that the last shipment would be April 16th. This morning I arrived at Ulta an hour before the store opened and waited. Once the doors opened, I excitedly rushed to the Too Faced section of the store and there. Were. No. Palettes. I saw the same red and green haired woman who ""helped"" me two weeks prior were helping other customers so I went to the woman at the cash register who then told me the shipment came on Thursday. Thursday???? Thanks a lot Ulta, I guess I will just have to spend $500 online for a palette I could've bought for $50 in store if you would have just told me the correct date.

They have a large selection of hair products, some of which are hard to find, like the original Paul Mitchell detangler; not one of the new iterations, but the original! They also have a mini MAC store and a fairly extensive list of makeup from all the major names, including IT cosmetics and of course, they have an ""in house"" salon. I wasn't as impressed with the skin care area, but then my favorite products can only be found online at the Dermstore so I'm probably not the right person to review their skincare selection. What impressed me the most was the customer service. I walked in the store and was greeted immediately and when I stopped in front of a display, a team member was right there to see if I needed help. When I wanted to try a shade of the product, she grabbed a clean makeup sponge and proceeded to help me find the right shade. She then stayed with me as  I browsed through the store to make sure I found everything I was looking for. At the checkout counter the team member was efficient but friendly and made sure that I knew how the rewards program worked (all they need is your phone number-no long paperwork holding everyone else up).

I went in for hair coloring which involved stripping my hair of color and then putting in the dye. The first time they put the dye in, the hair came out too golden, so we had to put in more dye. I don't mind considering we were trying to go for a specific shade of pink.

However, I noticed that they put something in my hair during the process that causes it to tangle LIKE CRAZY. My hair NEVER tangled this bad before getting my hair colored. We also didn't get quite the shade of pink I wanted and sadly as the time has gone by, with the color starting to lighten with my hair, it's actually closer to the color I want now.",,,0x88fae3f774351653:0xfcfef03ac4a56fa

I've been an Ulta shopper for several years and never had someone offer to help match me on anything. Tonight I was in need of foundation and wanted something different from my normal UD brand. I had been trying to match myself on the Born this Way brand and she came right over offering a suggested color and then took 2 shades and offered me a seat to match me. She was very knowledgeable of my current brand, this brand, and a third i had been considering. I shared with her my skin concerns and she deals with similar issues and was able to give me some tips. She even helped me get a powder (in Pür brand) to use as a setting powder or alone. I was very impressed by all the genuine help and knowledge. When I couldn't find my face wash (FaB) she offered to order it for me and ship it free.
I've always used the BWK GA store for most of my purchases, but after tonight I'll be heading back to Hinesville again and again. I hope somehow she sees this review. (She had her hair pulled back and it was dark root with purple) I thanked her several times, but would love her to really understand how rare it is to find genuine customer service these days.

That being said, I hadn't really been back until recently bc I absolutely love the size and option of selection for pretty much every single item. When I did return, I didn't expect it to be anything spectacular, since I already had in mind what I was going inside for. They were fairly busy, with two registers open and occupied checking customers out. However, BOTH employees acknowledged my walking in and took the time to say hello and pleasantries even though they were busy taking care of their other shoppers. This is kind of a big deal to me, being in customer service all of my working life! Good...no.  Fantastic start. I'm extremely fair complected, and sometimes have to battle with dark circles under my eyes as a result. Now, I already struggle finding a foundation to match my pale skin without causing a line, so I almost didn't even bother to look at concealer thinking I'd run into a similar issue. BUT there was a gentleman, obviously very feminine, and also wearing makeup standing pretty close to the door (sorry, I don't remember his name, but he was just fabulous!) I told him my potential dilemma and my budget lol, and before I could tell him my price range he had the perfect, reasonably priced concealer (a shade lighter than my ridiculously ghost colored foundation!) Mama Mia, it almost glows in the damn dark, but it's exactly what I needed and was super pleased with my shopping experience, as well as interaction with the staff!

She initially never acknowledged me when I got to the register by asking, ""How are are you?"" ""Did you find everything ok?"" or a simple ""Hello"". She just proceeded to ring up my items without saying a word. To break the ice, I cheerfully asked her, ""How are you today!?"" She didn't give an immediate reply when I spoke, it wasnt until about 5 seconds later she responded with a annoyed ""Hi"". After this experience, I dont think I'll return.

So, I went into ULTA desperate to find a makeup that would cover some bumps on my face that came out of the middle of nowhere 😲 After being there MAYBE 2 minutes... I was approached by this very helpful lady that was asking if I needed help. So of course I began explaining what was going on as she was carefully inspecting my face, & then.....  she made a LIFE-CHANGING suggestion that has in fact been just that....life changing! She told me to stop using pore minimizing primer (it's what I had in my hand) and to try using a hydrating primer instead....(as she placed the bottle in my hand) Then she walked me straight to a table in the front and suggested that I began using a moisturizer in the morning & at night. She said she believed that ALL THE BUMPS appear to be from my face being overly dry. Guess what, she was 100% right! My face DID start breaking out real bad when we had our 1st few really hot days bc I was sweating profusely. So to say the least... I've been using these 3 items religiously since and my face is completely clear again!!! I recommend everyone that loves make-up/beauty to this place. Yes, they're a little pricy BUT.....you get what you pay for! Cheap make-up aint good, & good make-up aint cheap... Pick which you'd rather have 🤷 I'm sticking with the ""good make-up aint cheap"" and paying that extra buck so I'll be back y'all 😃 👌

When I went to cash out, I received a .24 FL OZ tube of Clinique Moisture Surge FOR FREE!!! It's almost like it was meant to be! ❤ It might be a small amount but this little tube has lasted a very long time! A little goes a VERY long way with 90% of their stuff. But again, cheap is no good, and good isnt cheap! 👌 Sorry for such a long review, I just had to share 😊",,,0x88f3e13747cfd28d:0x4cd6dbd2fb5371aa

She went to find someone, but after standing there 10 minutes waiting for someone to come help me i got frustrated. I just decided to go to the register and order a tone of foundation online since they didn't have what i wanted to buy in store, in hopes that it was the right color.

I love ulta nd sometimes you can find some really good bargains but other items also seem to be overpriced. HUGE variety of brands nd always organized. Easy to find things as everything is categorized. The only problem I have with this location is that this is dalton nd unfortunately alot of the ppl here lack etiquette. Therefore it seems that EVERYTIME I enter the store, there is always kids running around nd yelling knocking merchandise off shelves or using it to play with while running in the store nd their mothers just stand there on the other side of the store picking out lip sticks nd eye lashes. Nd when someone makes an obvious gesture about how the yelling nd running is clearly upsetting other shoppers the mothers get an attitude nd bring them to their side but then they start screaming nd crying EXTREMELY loud nd dont do anything about it. Its frustrating nd that's the only reason why I hesitate to walk into this location. If not for that one issue, I would give a higher rating.",,,0x886075331e6ff26d:0xbe86a29a0102542b

I have a better experience at Macy's. I also spend a lot more because of it. I usually spend up to $200 at Mac Macy's and skin care even more. Because they tell me about things. I walked into ulta with a $50 gift card and only spent $25 of it. There was no one to help me want to use the rest.

Since Kailua lost first Liberty House then Macy's I've resorted to purchasing my cosmetics & fragrance online. Not much fun but beats driving ... the staff was fun the selection overwhelming at times, & even got a great haircut at a very reasonable price! And I love it! As long as I don't wander in there daily (since I adopted my favorite salesgirl) I won't end up with too many cosmetics I don't need. Seriously, they did carry the Lancome & Clinique products I do use, were generouse with the gifts with purchase & samples & the time spent one on one with customer service was impressive. They have daily specials on different product lines just fun to check out ... they meet the needs for any age, gender, for cosmetics, fragrance, hair, hair products, and much more.

The displays and testers were clean and for the most part everything was in it's proper place (aside from a few that were most likely accidentally placed in the incorrect spot by a customer after use). The staff was friendly and checked to make sure I was finding what I needed multiple times throughout my shopping trip. I took 1 star away because the selection wasn't the greatest. For example the Pür brand is exclusively carried only at Ulta not at Sephora. I stopped in looking for a Pür foundation only to find that this location doesn't carry Pür at all. On the drugstore side the selection is great. However, the prestige side (which is where the store should be making the most money) could use some work.

Ulta CDA gets one star simply because of selection. You can get drugstore brand make up and department store/high end beauty products in the same store. Huge selection of make-up, bath and body products, and tons of great brands for hair care. This specific store is terrible. The staff are indifferent if not out right rude, and that's if they aren't just ignoring you or sometimes no where to be found. Selling the higher priced beauty and hair products requires some product knowledge and customer service, in fact to an extent a lack of product knowledge can be overlooked when the staff is courteous and willing to help research/find answers to customer questions. If you're paying their prices you want to know what you're buying and not everyone knows exactly what they need. If you know your exact product, color, size etc then you'll probably be fine here but if you need to be product or shade matched good luck. They have one helpful person on staff, the Clinique rep. She is super nice, very helpful, and tries her best with the other products although I recently found that's she's a consultant and not an actual Ulta employee. Which actually makes more sense. I have an Ulta credit card, I shop pretty regularly but only because there is no other option in town. Its painful to spend money at this store because of the staff/employees. My most recent trip was in response to an area specific mailer, a sale for which they had no stock, they had an empty wall where their store makeup line used to be (Ulta Beauty) it was on the first page of a 10+ page mailer, but when I found someone to see if they had the sale items the response was ""yeah I don't know, maybe it's discontinued?"" Sale said ""Brand new products by Ulta Beauty"" they didn't stock for the sale. They had 30+ freebies (with purchase) on advertisement-they had 3. I left my name and number a week ago when the sale started and asked to be called when the Clinique rep came back (I was told she called in sick-very unprofessional) still no call.

I don’t know as a customer that sentence just doesn’t sit right for me. She didn’t even move to check. Stood there like a statue. We asked if there’s a clearance rack and they gave us the weirdest look. Go to another ulta or just go to Sephora. Ugh,,,0x880fc7f4d19ff7c7:0x1888c3028bac4771

No hello when we walked through the door. I knew what I wanted just needed a color match to be sure what shade to buy. I asked at the front desk after standing for a few minutes without help. She called someone, meanwhile two employees walked by and said they were helping other customers....and someone else would help me. So I waited and there were maybe 3 other customers in the store...where is the staff?

Updated: I got color matched in less than 30 seconds they gave me my color and I purchased it for around $40. When I got home I realized she had handed me the wrong color and when I went back to exchange at they were completely out of my shade. Even worse they emailed me a receipt which I never received so they told me they could not exchange without a receipt... I explained all of this to the manager. I couldn't even exchange it for the right color because they were out of stock. So frustrating...

We came on time for our appointment, and waited..... after 45 minutes and no acknowledgement from the sales associate, we left and went to a competitor. I called and the manager offered 20% off the next service, which I felt was a bit weak. But a few weeks later I came in wanting to use my 20% off and figured I'd give them one more try.... A different manager was working that day.. she gave me attitude the whole time and made me feel quite uncomfortable. I politely asked about the 20% off and if I could use that and if she could ask her co-worker about it but the way she responded had me straight back to the competitor and I won't be back.

1.1304036281958095e+20,Julianna Scott,1584321492453,5,so this is a review for ulta salon... prior to going in i had chemically damaged hair. i created this disaster back in aug of 2019. I had went to a reputable salon a week prior to get something done. i was pretty open to anything considering what i was working with.  that reputable salon didnt really want to do much with it and wanted to color it in stages. that sounded pricey so i went to ulta with no hope. but they were willing to do whatever i wanted with the understanding i could potentially damage it further. they did talk with me about what i was thinking and we agreed on a dark purple with shadow root. i wanted different dimensions of purple. i wish i knew the ladies name who did my hair however long story short she did a great job and after 2 washings since leaving the salon my hair is more softer and overall healthier. not only is my hair better but the price though was cheap. i was thinking 150 to 200 for what she did i left with a hundred dollar bill not including the tip. i am so happy with my hair and i I included pictures. you can just look at hair and can tell that its healthy. which is just mind blowing to me. will definitely return and definitely reccomend. will update with the name of the hair dresser.,"[{'url': array(['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgYPyslwG7aG0f8_H_pjucQjPasK7VgNZgL8oO=w150-h150-k-no-p'],

I was in the store for over 10 minutes, multiple employees walked past me and didn't ask if I needed any help. I had to ask for help at the front counter.

I don't understand why all the employees don't have Hand held devices to check out customers. The lines to check out are always long and ridiculous.

Ulta keeps wanting to pretend they can sell prestige and luxury products but shopping there is like shopping at TJ Maxx or Walgreens. When cosmetics cost the same at all retailers,  why bother with a lackluster shopping experience when you can be treated like you matter at a department store or just order online.

It is just this location, as Ulta has expanded their customer service has become nonexistent.

The customer service is excellent, from a first day employee I met, Sadie, a Benefit Specialist of only a few months in town, Alex, to the Retail Manager, Dovie.  ALL of the employees are truly interested in helping meet your beauty, cosmetic, hair care, and skin regimen needs.  Many of them have gone far above and beyond for me.  They have encouraged products that work for me and tried them on me, while discouraging ones that weren't as flattering.  They also truly promote the feeling of beauty from within and expressing oneself while having fun with getting ready.  Thanks to the great customer service, I've tried many new things I probably wouldn't have dared before.  And the compliments I get are amazing!  So much fun!  They also have brought the complacency out of my mother.  She got an amazing brow tint from Alex for the first time and her brows have never looked better, especially with her now going grey, short and spunky with her hairstyle!  She also stepped out of the box, and found a non-feathering lipstick by Too Faced Cosmetics, which has been a concern at her age.  She tried two awesome new colors that she would have never tried, had she not been encouraged to in the store.  Now, I can't find her without them on!  Ulta Beauty in Springfield is the very best.  I try not to go anywhere else!  I'm a Platinum, loyal customer due to Dovie, Jocelyn, Sadie, Brooklyn, Alex, Hope, Madison and many others that are there to bring your inner beauty out!

Be aware that this store will push you to try different products, but if you buy something get home and hate it they let you bring it back! Even after you tried it!

My sister and I visited your store today and the selection is really good but the costumer service is horrible.  I have never felt so disappointed and discriminated. The cashier that help us have us had really bad attitude (we're Spanish/ english speaking) treat us really bad, ignored our questions, talked to us with attitude and she make sure we knew how annoyed she was to help us check out. She was simply rude,  while she was so nice to some other costumers (fully english speaking consumers) try to help them even tho they were being help already.

There’s no point in legit YELLING at a customer when YOU fail to keep temporary face masks in your facility. You can kindly ask the customers to leave but I think her upbringing was lacking.  Perhaps Rachel never learned to properly greet and politely ask someone to leave. Her tone and attitude are unwelcoming and inappropriate. Please refrain from interacting with her at the cashier. She makes transactions awkward and uncomfortable. In case her name isn’t actually Rachel she has short blond hair and looks like a stuck up brat who hates her life and job.

It is not the best place for quick, targeted shopping trips, as many displays are changed and/or reordered and so you cannot just buzz in expecting to find the MAC display where it was, say last week. Today on the holiday (Easter/Passover) weekend, this store was crowded and noisy, but heavily staffed, mostly with people walking around asking people if they require assistance about every 3-4 minutes.  It may just be me, buy nothing can drive me from a store faster than having personnel hover, redundantly asking if I need help, and not believing my answers.  Today, I grabbed a few things off my list and boogied on out.  I was exhausted to begin with, and the sales clerk polka was beyond me.

My only complaint was that the brush section needs to be refilled because there weren't as many options that I was hoping for, but I did go on a busy weekend.",,,0x880fcf41d1d9cdbf:0x9213629971dd64cf

For someone who wears little makeup and only shops ULTA for Christmas gifts or a specialty item here and there, they are pushy at the check outs for personal information and get testy when you refuse to give your phone number or join the ULTA membership.
Returns even with a receipt are impossible without giving up personal information.",,,0x880fcf41d1d9cdbf:0x9213629971dd64cf

Were this Review on this Salon alone I'd give it 5⭐s. The Store seems to be well stocked w/items they advertise. The store's Reps, for the most part, lack personality, dream or are just lazy. Every section is occupied by reps who ""work in a different section"".  They ""cannot help/answer questions"". This was the 4th time I waited in checkout line while people obviously grew impatient, if not walking out the door, due to the lack of open registers (there are 3 or 4 but rarely more than one CASHIER). Groups of Sales reps doing nothing but holding up tables or walls, appearing to be absorbed in convos unrelated to ULTA-  are in plain sight but NOT at a register! I won't get into various probs occurring at registers, remarks made by cashiers that are not apropos ... if you have time, like I did that day, then shop here. Don't go here knowing nothing about what you want, you have product questions, etc.. Don't shop here if you need to be in and out. Otherwise, yeah, it's okay.",,,0x880fcf41d1d9cdbf:0x9213629971dd64cf

The employees were too busy talking to one another instead of helping folks that I decided to go elsewhere for what I needed. Today I went back to give it a second try because a co-worker told me about a good mascara. 1. Again nobody asks if you need help. 2. Products were not near the price labels so I didn't know which makeup kit cost what and I got tired of trying to match price tags to labels. 3. They don't sell MAC cosmetics at this store. 4. There was a 40% off price sign right above the mascara I wanted. I told this to the woman at the register when it wrang up wrong and her manager said it was a particular mascara, which was not clear from any of their signs, and there was no discount on mine. I'd maybe go another Ulta sometime, but I'll be steering clear of this one.",,,0x880f99997809f01d:0x23c8080052b667f1

They are frequently out of stock of alot of items. One manager was extremely ignorant and rude about their coupon policy which I happened to be right about after visiting the rockford location the next day and having no issue using my coupon for the exact same items I tried to use it on in dekalb. On a different occasion a different manager allowed me to use an online only coupon in stores I'm assuming to not lose the sale to their store however it helped me out greatly so was much appreciated.

I told her my hair lifted orange if she used ash and I guess she thought I didn't know what I was talking about. She also cut my hair and it ended up being 2inches off. I mean one side was almost 2 inchces longer than the other. I called the next day to complain and wanted my color fixed the manager was rude and acted like I was a huge inconvience and she tried charging me for the fix.

1.0228328811362843e+20,Megan Stanger,1513448737363,2,I've been to the Ulta in Goshen and I loved it. The Ulta in Warsaw turned me off quite a bit. Upon walking in I wasn't greeted which is not a huge deal. I actually needed help finding what I was looking for so I stood at the front door like a deer in headlights for a few minutes and still no one approached me. I decided to venture into the store down numerous aisles and finally found the one I was looking for it. By now I've had a number of Associates walked by me and no one offered to assist me. So I got my phone out and looked up what I was looking for and found that Target had it for cheaper so I went elsewhere. I'll definitely be back to Ulta in Goshen definitely not Warsaw.

1.0818085792599392e+20,R. A.,1532237799176,3,"I used to really like this Ulta and it used to be my favorite one.   However lately every time I visit I have had a negative experience thanks to the employees to the point that I'm just kinda like nah, i would rather not have my evening ruined by rudeness.  My last visit all the employees were gathered around a makeup display that i was waiting to look at,  gossiping like high schoolers (although to be fair they didn't look much older than high schoolers).  No one really acknowledged or acted like  there were customers in the store, it was awkward.

My past few experiences have been marred by cashier rudeness.  I was met with an attitude for asking about a sale sign and having a price double checked.  I've always been very polite because I know being a retail cashier can suck but i don't think it's too much to just be kind in return.

I'll probably start shopping more at the Fort Wayne Ultas if i can,  I shopped there for years before moving and can't remember ever feeling dread when walking into their stores.

Update 7-22: the atmosphere has GREATLY improved at this location since I wrote this review.  There's a lot of different people there now and it seems like a much friendlier polite atmosphere. I've gone back to shopping here more.0",,,0x88169eaf42edb957:0x9bcd07671f44bd49

I had a rough time letting anyone do anything with my hair after my sister passed away suddenly a few years ago because she was my stylist for so long. My boyfriend talked me into trying the salon at Ulta and I've never been so glad. Although all the stylists are great and I love how personable and easy to talk to they all are, Diana is my miracle worker. With her work and recommendations I went from box- dyed black with bleached blonde under on only one section (over- processed, damaged, breaking, etc.) To what I have now. She was able to color correct my mistakes over time but in the process she gave me a color and style I could live with. When I went back recently and asked for a red shade she perfectly gave me what I needed for my skin tone and gave me a style that worked for my fine hair, made expert product recommendations that have brought softness and body and life back to my hair. The girls here are so sweet and attentive. I have always had great customer service with beauty purchases and returns too. I appreciate that the people are helpful and knowledgeable and never pushy!

When I walked in before (2years+) I was greeted with a smile and asked how I could be helped. It felt genuine and the person would stay with me the whole shopping trip if I wished. If I was just browsing someone would check back in with me to see if I needed help later in my trip. Not so anymore. Every time I go in - and I do mean every - I am lucky if I get asked if I need help and I more often than not have to search for someone. Then, once found, they are quick to scurry away from me. Are they busy you ask. You bet. Talking about their weekends, their boyfriends, their vacations, their surgeries, their hang. overs. No joke. I hear more about their lives than about products. Complete disrespect unless you ooze money walking in the door - then you might attract attention. I don't feel welcome or respected here. That's why I go to Sephora now as often as I can.

On our way to the checkout one of the awesome young lady (im so upset at myself i didn't catch her name) that work there caught us and informed us on a promotion with that certain brand we were buying.  So we spent a few dollars more and left with a free flat iron and tote bag! Boom!
Little things like this (and sharing the experience) make for better customer service stories and happier shopper's

Rude and ugly, rather stand around and talk  to each other. Never ever anyone to help you with anything
I have walked around store for an hour and not one person offered help
Went to store to return item, lady Very  obviously did not want to help And was upset that she had to stop hanging out with her coworkers and chitchatting, Refused to let me return my item with the receipt because I bought it 32 days ago because their policy is now 30 days. I have been a diamond elite member for many years and I am full aware of their return policy and that this woman was completely wrong. I called customer service and all they could do was apologize and tell me to go back to the store which I don’t think I’m ever going to go back to that store I’d rather throw away the item and lose the money thing go back and continuously deal with the rude customer service since the day they opened.
Store is always Disorganized and dirty

Well, when I gave my daughter's account I was told I couldn't get my birthday item unless I had an email coupon. Never been a problem before, they did have an account under my name, but no email coupon. So I did not get my birthday item. And believe me, I was looking forward to it, they are usually good.

The layout is open, inviting, attractive; with a good variety of brands in every kind of beauty item. The ""drug store brands"" section is spacious and easy to shop, and the higher end brands are displayed in their own mini shop, warmly lit and well stocked. Unfortunately most cosmetic brands are not as stringent with their ingredients as they should be and Ulta doesn't carry many of the cleaner, more natural/organic/free of chemicals brands but you'll find some! Clearance is all shelved together making that an easy find. Zoya holo for $4?! Umm, yes!",,,0x4cb203d7a345bdeb:0x3c5b1e7bb59a7e9e

(Available at other locations. I do understand since the store is large and they have space.) Sales associates offer help but beware if they are wearing headphones. The calls are more important than the customers and they will drop you and focus 100% on the caller. Finally able to get assistance from the same person and she seemed mad that I walked away while she was on a call and clearly not speaking to me. Just a disappointing experience. Next time I will shop online.,,"{'text': ""We're sorry to hear this, Jennifer, as we strive to show our guests how much we appreciate them all.

I love that they moved to a larger location because of the variety of products, but if I ever want something from Ulta beauty, I’ll simply get it online, it is more convenient and I won’t have to deal with employees who are rude but show it in a subtle manner, for that reason, I won’t be returning.
Please, Ulta beauty teach your employees business professionalism, if they are having a bad day, they shouldn’t take it out on the customers and install cameras in all aisles so people don’t have to be followed around. It is creepy and loyal customers like myself aren’t thieves.

If you walk in the store at almost any time of day, there are maybe 4 or 5 employees there total, and none of them offer any service or assistance. So don't go in there looking for advice or with any questions, because you will find no help whatsoever. I have also found many of the upper management to be rather rude as well when dealing with them.
To top all of that off, the stock is usually rather lackluster. This store is generally out of many things, and I found that they don't even carry some products from my favorite brands.

I arrived early morning about an hour after opening abs proceeded to wander around.  There was 1 young lady on register checking out customers.  No other employees were on the floor.  I asked for help and she did call the back for someone... which I appreciated.   I wanted to try Juvia foundation.... a brand I never wore before.  Everything and I mean ever is wrapped up so you can’t use or really see a tester.  I get it:  we are still working thru Covid restrictions.  So I asked if she could open and maybe let me see a few.  She said no.  I can do my best to help you and if you don’t like it you can bring it back.  Now... she wasn’t rude and I’m sure she is just stating policy that they have told her to say.   But... who has time to keep running back to ultra because your foundation didn’t match!!!  That’s a waste of time!  I decided if I’m going to do that I may as well order using Amazon  from the comfort of my couch.  Next day shipping and easy returns!  A better policy would have been ‘ only employees can open testers for you’.,,,0x89c80f0537d1342d:0x9a845d4e7c0060ee

The prices will vary drastically depending on the service you get and what you're having done, so there's not a good way to determine what the end cost is going to be. I always book online with whoever is available, and this is probably not a good idea.

For my latest salon service I wanted my hair bleached and then dyed one solid color. I was quoted $250 by the stylist when I got in the chair, which was a more than I was expecting but I said it was fine. 4 or 5 hours later, I was told that my total would be TWICE that amount, and my jaw almost fell off. I did spend at least an hour sitting and doing nothing in the middle of my service because my stylist (master level iirc) went to cut someone else's hair. So she took an hour's worth of work off my total .... which was great, but my bill still came out to over $400 when I was originally quoted $250. There was also several times I was sitting at the sink when she said she'd be back in a few minutes, and it turned into a half an hour. I spent half the day at the the sink, which was really uncomfortable, especially because the neck pillow kept falling off. At one point the dye got in my eye which was extremely painful, so I had to go to the sink and wash it out with paper towels the best I could. Then when the stylist blow dried my hair, she literally burned my ear! Salon hairdryers are uncomfortably hot, but I've never outright had someone burn me with one before. I was very patient with all of this and still left an appropriate tip of 20%+ for the services. Still, I don't think I'll be using the Ulta salon anymore. (They also tried to get me to schedule to get my roots done a month later for another $120... no thanks. I'll learn how to bleach my own hair.)

I'll come back for the products but I'm done with the salon, unfortunately.",,"{'text': 'We want you to love your hair, so we appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention.

There was a lot of missing inventory in the section I was looking to purchase from. After trying to find merchandise for 5 minutes, I had to walk back to the entrance to ask for help. The person was eager and nice, but I felt like it could have been a better experience. I think other customer were looking for help too, because one stopped her to ask questions while she was helping me. I ended up finding the item myself, after she said they didn't have it and when I got to the register, the cashier had stepped away to help someone on the floor.

I followed up with ""what do you recommend we do"" and got no response. I typically really enjoy Ulta, but this is pretty disappointing.

Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon to inquire about a new eyeshadow palette I was interested in purchasing. I was greeted at the door and decided to browse the store to see the new additions before picking up the palette. As I was browsing, I noticed that the shelves were very poorly stocked and the displays were messy and disorganized. Maybe I caught them right before a restock? During my browsing I was never asked if I needed help finding anything. Being put-off by the mess I decided to search for this eyeshadow palette to no avail. After hovering around the immediate area for 10 minutes, I finally found a group of employees standing around chatting and asked if they could check if the palette was in stock. One employee spoke up and asked rudely if I had looked for the palette yet. To which I replied, yes and mentioned that the website shows it as in stock. She didn't skip a beat on informing me that I can't rely on the website and that if I didn't see it then it's obviously not in stock; no offer was even made to double check that I hadn't missed it.

I always hear the horror stories about ULTA and Sephora employees not helping customers when they aren't done up. WELL, I experienced that first hand this weekend! I wandered the makeup isle aimlessly trying to figure out what brands had what. I watched the girls APPROACH CUSTOMERS that had their hair and makeup done and ask if they needed help. Not ONCE did anyone ask if I needed anything. Yes, I could have asked for assistance but the fact that any other time I have been in there with at least my makeup done, someone has helped me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

After ULTA screwing up my rewards & now this, I'm kind of done with them.",,,0x89b7e0f7b514ee9d:0xd3b2e10bd04103b4

However, this was not the 1st time I had been in there were I was only greeted at the door as I guess it is easy for them to yellnat you as you walk in.  On this evening, Tuesday, they clustered and talked about their ""Hangryness"" and how someone better direct them to ""Royal Farms"" so they could eat?  Anyway, as you enter the door, the girls who congregate at the register yell ""Welcome to Ulta.""  But ill be damned if I didnt walk the store looking for an employee to ""help"" color match match me with a new foundation that just launched and I couldnt find anyone with a nametag for 45 min! When i finally got one of the girls to leave a register she was just holding up, she said they were about to close and it would need best to come back the next day? Really, NP, Ill just go to Sephora to be color matched next time and order online if I want something from Ulta.",,,0x89b7e0f7b514ee9d:0xd3b2e10bd04103b4

Without any division she told me it was her quick technique. Which seemed very unprofessional to me. I let her know that I don't like her technique and she doesn't care about it. My color is super uneven. To apply the color that way, I better do it at home. I can still see my gray hair and my hair is in 3 colors. When she dried my hair I tumbled the dryer down without any division after 1 hour my hair was frizzy and all curls. The girl is very kind but her techniques were terrible.

I won a jefree star giveaway and won 2 giftcards totally 500.00 so i picked this ulta to spend it at it took me a almost 40 mins to get there from Dudley mass. First impressions walking in it was big..  No one greeted me or asked me if i needed help upon entering and i arribed at 10:18 am. I grabbed a bag and started looking around . i got super overwhelmed due to amount of money i had to spend.  But i had a list.   First item on my list was for morphe products and brushes.  I found christina up at the registers she was awsome she walked around helping me. Excellent employee. She tells me there is no morphe brushes or products cause they dont get many in ....super bummed... Not one single morphe product.  After walking around with her .  they were out of almost every single item i wanted ... Toofaced born this way foundation, mac products they only had lil travel size setting sprays and there famous two shades of red lipsticks.  Selection was horrible ...... Angela at the bennifit brow bar was awsome she took over for christina and helped me find products i should get like brow pen ils mascara and blush palettes.  All in all it was a fun experience .  those two employees were great they need a award ya couldnt have asked for better customer service honest to god. But the selction sucked!!!

When I called to inform the store I was there for my order, the employee asked for my information and brought out my order. When she handed me the bag she said that she thinks the policy for pickups is an hour before close. However when I called the stores recording said curbside for this week was from 11am-6pm and had the policy not reflected the hours she could have informed me then. I picked up my order at 5:30-5:35. I’ve placed many online/curbside orders and this is the first I’ve ever heard of this policy. This is really disappointing since this ulta is only 5 minutes away and I do most of my beauty supply shopping here.",,"{'text': 'Hi there! Thank you for sharing your experience.

Is it too much to get some good eye shadow pallet brands in there? That is my major complaint. The staff has always been really nice. My daughter loves the store. Good variety of non makeup things. I love buying my shampoo and conditioner there. My husband was with me a week ago. He said something about the price. Told him it's a good thing I buy my own things lol. I would really like to find someone to help me with foundation and powder to match my skin tone. I stood there for 10 minutes looking around for help. It's organized nicely. Easy to figure out where things are you know you want. I love the sales rack. I would recommend this location to others.,,,0x883cf171b7e300a9:0x9c30c698b0293104

Whether it's a makeup palette or lipstick from Urban Decay or a bottle of perfume from one of the many they offer it will be a good bet that she will like it. They also have a great selection of colognes from all the best designers. Staff is helpful and knows the products but tends to annoy me after I have been in the store for a few minutes.

The girl I finally got to help me told me they didn't have the product I had bought at another Ulta (which probably means she didn't know where it was) then I settled for another foundation which she told me didn't come with a sponge and then tried to make me buy a brush for (another $42).

I never get asked for my rewards card so they can add my points and sometimes I get randomly followed. I trusted an Ulta in Coon Rapids to do my hair and makeup for my wedding and they were awful and then demanded a tip. You can't even hide my blemishes on my wedding day even though I'm paying you and then the cashier has the nerve to ask for money? No thanks.

The girls at Ulta don't really have good makeup on ever, so I'm not sure if they have any makeup experience period, but I would expect common courtesy as far as customer service goes and it's never the case when I visit.

Go to Sephora instead. I've shopped there for years and the atmosphere is completely different.",,,0x52b45f0f2ed93f99:0x94a56b99e6c52723

I walked around for about 10 minutes looking for a specific product and when I could not find it I stopped and asked an employee if they had any tangle teezer hairbrushes she looked at me and says “I am not sure, I am new” she continued to stand there and look confused for about a minute then went and asked another employee who basically ignored her and answered the phone and walked away. She came back to me and said “sorry I am not sure and it is really busy right now” there were maybe 10 to 15 people in the store and 1 person waiting at the register. I never did get my answer or find it. I decided to give them another shot and do a pick up order for a bottle of lotion today and it took 10 minutes after I checked in to have the item brought out to my car which was strange since once again the parking lot was fairly empty. This employee did at least apologize for the wait. I am not sure if it’s a staffing issue or if they just don’t have great customer service but it certainly does not make me want to come back.",,,0x52b3236eaf105175:0x8393439a89fcfab0

I'm used to having nail supplies near the makeup, like many other retailers have it. They DID have the weird, hard-to-find item I needed, but I don't think I ever would have been able to find it on my own. But bonus points to the associate that was able to look up on a device, verify it's what I wanted, then go find it in store for me before checking out.
I wish some of their makeup tools had the cheaper ones in ""bulk"" for sale, like cheap foundation wedge sponges, 6 for a buck, kinda thing. There's a lot of makeup DIYs that use those.
However, they had a great variety of makeup cases for almost every storage need from the large ones that are a little over a foot tall, to little ones that you can carry in your purse. If I didn't already have a case, I would have picked up one of theirs!
All in all, it's Ulta. Since I've been visiting their stores more often the past year, their prices are MUCH more competitive than years ago and if I need more than one makeup or moisturizing item, I go there instead of my usual WalMart/Target.",,,0x52b3236eaf105175:0x8393439a89fcfab0

Yesterday I bought a expensive concealer that came  with a free gift. Tried it on and it didn’t work. I returned it only to be told for the first time that I had to return the whole free gift it came with three items. I went home and found majority of everything except for this mini sponge. Thinking since I had the receipt and everything else that they would work with me never happened. They told me that this is their policy and without everything I couldn’t return only exchange for a different color. What is very upsetting  to me coming from someone whose worked retail for two years is that they kept repeating the same thing to me instead trying to come up with a solution because at that point I just wanted to return it and get my money back. Now I would understand if I was told this about their return policy while purchasing the concealer,  or even if it was notated on the receipt then it wouldn’t be a big deal to me but that was never the case. I even would have  been ok with a gift card with the full amount I paid. So FYI if you purchase something and thinking you may end up returning  the item ask  about their return policy when it comes to specific stuff because I would hate for you to end up like me today upset and feeling like nothing was ever resolved and given little to nothing returned back on my card.",,"{'text': ""We're sorry to hear that you were disappointed by your visit with us.

1.0935183856864874e+20,Andrea Khan,1429799131402,1,Upon entering the store the associates jeered and proceeded to go in a corner to make snide remarks as I was without makeup and dressed down. I received no help from anyone and they went out of their way to make themselves unavailable to assist as I took my time to walk the whole perimeter of the store. Was not sure if it was because of this or perhaps I was the wrong color but they make it very clear that I was not welcome there. And when I left I noticed there was no one at the register in case I wanted to purchase something. Don't worry because hell will freeze over before I spend a dime at ulta I went elsewhere and made my purchases where I was valued as a customer and a human being.

1.1253571279553243e+20,Desade Desade,1479068998698,2,"Talent management is quintessential. It is not enough to greet customers with a smile. An employee should have or at least attempt to obtain knowledge of the products that are sold at this ULTA. I encountered a person with a kind demeanor, but lacking in the area of knowledge, and this hindered the employee's ability to process information, accurately- creating unnecessary confusion and dissatisfaction. I had to endure apathetic tones and dismissive attitudes from other staff members- who this employee sought information from. Needless, to say I walked away displeased and this store will miss out on future sales. For you see- I may not have appeared to be a person that is highly invested in cosmetics on this particular day, it was a Saturday- I was very casual, and  without makeup. I deliberately came to ULTA without makeup, because I was looking for new foundation and other skin care products.  Consequently, the assumption that appeared to be the supporting driver to deliver poor and apathetic service is unfortunate for this location. I spend a lot of money on self-care products and I have friends and family members that do same- whom I will be advising not to attend this location. ULTA employees are the frontline implementers of ULTA'S strategies, when the employees turn off the consumer they are only creating opportunities for their competition like Sephora... Poor customer service has a negative impact on the bottom line.",,,0x87df37e603946bed:0x9ec830f9cba03cb7

Being that I'm on vacation I had to buy a small bottle of Redkin Hair conditioner and a comb. During my visit no employee approached me. After looking around there were only 4 customers in the store and I was one of them. I didn't see any workers on the sales floor only one at the salon doing a client's hair and a cashier. Can't really give a offical review being that there was nobody to review but the cashier.  Nothing special in regards to checking out.,,,0x80c8d6b410317733:0x89d78bd26d34e5d6

1.0588707957500156e+20,Angie Nunya,1440364666731,2,"Just go to a nice quiet salon if you are willing to pay these insane prices!!
My girlfriend and I got our hair done here since they offered 25% off your first ""service”. Be careful in the meaning of this promotion; they define this as 25% off a portion (the least costly action) of your visit. They break up your appt into specific portions; for example a haircut, a color, and a highlight are individual services so they try to only take 25% off only one of these functions. This is completely misleading. After the discount the total cost was still far more than what anyone should be paying for a cut and color. I've found most of the salons in the entire Las Vegas area are charging prices you'd expect to see on the strip. I may have visited another Ulta salon if the prices were realistic. But this isn't Hollywood and we're not celebrities so expecting people to pay $150-$200+ (one of the stylists charged over $200!!!) for haircuts and colors is absurd...and then to expect tips..just ridiculous, these aren't surgeons. Also, my girlfriend got pink put in her hair and there was quite a price charged for this, but the color was completely gone after only a week and half!! If it wasn't going to hold, that should have been clearly communicated up front.
My stylist was very nice, but I asked for red color with partial highlights and I'm now a blond with no red at all.",,,0x80c8d6b410317733:0x89d78bd26d34e5d6

They think your going to shoplift & act like there straighten up the shelve wherever you are, or 2. They are trying to push product on you (I get it..

I walk in with my hair a mess and I walk out feeling really good about my hair. She's friendly, honest, and great to see while I'm at Ulta.

I asked an associate if she could check the back and she said delivery was in the morning.
I returned to the location that Tuesday (5 days later) to find that there was still no Maybelline green primer and there were 2 NYX Microbrow pencil in the espresso cubby. I also looked for a facial pore scrub but nope, not there. I grabbed one and got home (35 miles away) to discover it was Auburn!!! Either its out of stock or not in the right place.

To sum it up this is a nice store, some empty holes on the shelves which is understandable I believe they are a high traffic store. I go there every 4-8 weeks to get my hair trimmed (I have a pixie) and always have Gianna do it as she does a great job. The staff are friendly people, usually quite knowledgeable but if they don't know something they do their best to find out for you. I was terribly upset when Ulta as a whole stopped carrying Laura Geller, now they have stopped carrying Kate Somerville. They have really nice sales and nice things on clearance occasionally. I was a little upset when I spent $400 today and didn't get any samples at checkout. Next week I'll be getting my first facial at this Ulta and will report back once done🙂.

[EDIT] The facial with microdermabrasion was definitely worth the money, I noticed my skin brighter and generally more glowy than it has ever looked right away. I'll be going back in 5 weeks for just the microdermabrasion and in ten weeks for the facial+MDB. I'm very happy with my results. The ONLY improvement I suggest is to offer dermaplaning; it's very popular know and just leaves you so smooth! [END EDIT]",,,0x89c6cbbebd9789bf:0xddfe5a5440d73af2

I've been a huge Ulta fan for three years now, ever since I had a mid-life crisis, changed careers, became an esthetician, and started buying every single beauty product I own at Ulta. I've recently started coming to this mall and just this past weekend decided to check this Ulta out with my teenaged sister. I was immediately put off at how it wasn't that busy in there, yet not one person said ""hello"" or offered to help me. One of them looked right at me and passed me numerous times, and nothing. It astounded me because I felt it was obvious that I didn't know where anything was. Maybe it was because I had my toddler with me? She just pretended she was dusting the store and not to mention that her make-up application was downright scary. I hate to sound this way, but she looked like a tacky vampire, in an attempt to showcase as many products as possible on her face, i guess? When did such an unrealistic look become a thing? I guess I sound naive when I put it that way. Anyway, I didn't rate a 2 because the Benefit girl helped me out, and then this other girl was super nice to my child, and wound up being my cashier- she saved the whole situation. I'll update when I get her name.",,,0x89c3d42532ca8baf:0xa69d15d499919f34

I usually shop for both drug store as well as prestigious cosmetics. If it's drugstore, I go into they're website for they're $3.50 off coupon. Sometimes they offer a 20% off the products. This can be a huge savings when purchasing a cosmetics or blow dryers or straight iron.
This store is one of my favorite locations. Everything is neat and clean. The same associates are extremely helpful. Best in mind, you cannot get samples here like Sephora's. Clinique is the only beans that will offer you a sample. When checking out, make sure to ask if any of your purchases cubes with a bonus sample. Sometimes they do and the associates forget because it's so busy.
Twice a year, the have huge sales on the prestigious cosmetics. Huge savings for that month. Look carefully because each day during that month, they have different offerings.

1.129701708289391e+20,Darrell Wood,1562281353502,1,Ulta At Deptford: was trying to find this palette today and could not find it when I asked the manager who was doing a display set up if she could help me find it she rolled her eyes and literally reached her hand on the corner of the morphe display and pulled one for me. Looked at me like I was dumb for not finding it... checkout was another nightmare as as patient as i was trying to be there was an older associate ringing who did not know what she was doing and should be trained more. She forgot to give the change to the guest in front of me. Called over the same manager who handed me the palette while yelling at me someone would be with me in a moment. It took me 15 mins to get rung out with only one person in front of me being helped. just got home and went to open it and this is what it looked like! What?!?! This is not even usable and when I called customer service she was very sassy with me stating that I “should not do anything crazy tonight”  and literally chuckled at me and told me I can take my time to address this situation. For the rudeness across the store from not only associates but managers and customer service I am appalled at this. This is not how you treat customers who want to spend money and you should check your products to make sure they are not damaged before you put them out. I will communicating my upset through all my social media platforms and google review as well.

I had my receipt, I had the packaging,  I told her I couldn't put the dye back because I put it on my hair. She called someone, and  then she said NO.

1.0576263305915402e+20,Niki Carroll,1557766842903,5,"I visit this store about once a month. They usually always have what I came for in stock. My most recent trip on Thursday May 9th 2019, I found a new color I hadn't previously tried of the Anastasia Dip Brow Pomade which I wanted to purchase after swatching the tester. There weren't any left in to purchase,  so I asked a manager if they perhaps had more stock somewhere they could grab for me. The manager had another employee check their stock drawer, however there were none left in stock. The employee suggested that I may have them order it for me and have it shipped to my home for free,  all for the same price I'd pay on store. After about 5 minutes of the manager attempting to order this item for me we realized it wasn't going through because I was using a debit card not a credit card (not sure why the register and website both take debit cards but this process didn't) so I was unable to have it ordered. However,  the manager gave me a card that gives a code to be used when ordering online that gives free shipping so that I could still get it ordered and delivered for store price. Like most other stores, they could have just told me it was out if stock and called it a day. However, they went out of their way to be friendly and very helpful which was appreciated. A man was also very friendly and helpful when assisting me with trying to find aftershave for my boyfriend. Overall, the staff is very outgoing and helpful, but not pushy or overbearing whatsoever.

Quite a few times I went in for specific items on sale and turns out they weren't actually on sale like they stated. When you ask for something specific, you are generally walked to the newest, latest and 'greatest' products that they are trying to push while they convince you it's what you need when it really isn't. I went in with a friend who needed something for the puff under their eyes, they showed them everything BUT what they asked for..... EVERY single thing you're looking for? You're taken over to the brand new way overpriced items. Their associates need more training,  specifically on their people skills. You could literally walk around for 20 minutes not knowing where something is and I can't even tell you how many employees will walk right by you and not say a word. I've only met two helpful people at this location and I've gone a few times. The problem now is, if you DO ask for help... again, you're taken over to the brand new items that you likely can't afford seeing as how you CAME IN BECAUSE THINGS WERE ON SALE ...I'd rather order online and hope it turns out good vs go into this store. It's the closest Ulta to me and that makes me sad. It's really the younger employees that are the problem. They act like special snowflakes, especially when you don't want the product they directed you towards. ESPECIALLY when it comes to price, you get the snobbiest looks which doesn't make a potential customer feel all that great. Good thing about this joint?

1.0576988020748832e+20,Tyshiena Johnson,1576152605438,5,I bought my first good foundation from here. I didn't know where to even start. You automatically walk into a heaven of powdered and liquid products ready to be put on your face and nails. I had a really nice gentleman help me find my complexion based foundation based on my personal needs when it comes to the conditon of my skin which is definitely a bonus. He even applied it to my face so I know I'm getting the right one. It is a little pricey there but the make up is fantastic and it will last you a long time. :),,,0x89c133080894d907:0x457d462952082336

The employees don’t even bother to greet you or show you where a product is (if they even know the product you need is). It’s not hard to be friendly nor is it a huge or difficult task taking two minutes to show someone who is interested in your products where one is so they can purchase it. Sephora is 10 steps away and actually has customer service.,,"{'text': ""Hi Stephanie! We're very sorry to hear that our store team wasn't able to assist you.

She stumbles over her words then says ok, we will see you tomorrow. I say ok thank you it’s at 1 right? She responds with no we rescheduled it for 12 due to scheduling issues, I politely agree and let her know I’ll see them Saturday. The following day I get another call that’s says they only have two girls to work on all of us so we all need to show up at the same time and we will just have to wait until they will get to one of us. I again say ok frustrated but say thank you. I then get worried and go into Ulta to speak to someone to clarify everything. At this point I’m told they have again rescheduled my appointments and the last one will be at 3:45. Enter panic mode, I explain to this woman my wedding is it 4:30 and there is no way this will work and expressed my frustration with all the changes the company took upon themselves to make without even letting me know times had been rescheduled and changed even though I had made this appointment a month prior with specific instructions it was for my wedding and what time we needed to be done but I received no apology instead was told to just show up the next day and that’s all. I leave feeling completly defeated but at this point it’s the day before my wedding I have no other choice. At 7:30 that night I received another call from them telling me I have to be there at 10:30 in order to get all of us taken care of in time because the other girl helping her is brand new. Less than 24 hrs before my wedding day they drop this on me. I ask her about our hair because we had appointments for 3 full makeup’s and three hairstyles and want to make sure that the two of us that are using clip in extensions will still be ok and was told we can try but the girl that specializes in those had an emergency and wasn’t gonna be there. This woman wanted me and my girls to show up at 10:30 in the morning to have all of this done in time for a 4:30 wedding so explain that it isn’t going to work because that’s to early,  hair will go flat and our makeup won’t be right for the wedding.  All I was given was well that’s the best we can do. Mind you all of this was going to cost roughly 350 dollars. I was completely devastated and had no idea what we were going to do at this point. Luckily the Dillard’s girls were able to take us all as well Regis was able to do our hair, thankfully my amazing husband who went out at 8 at night to fix the mess Ulta had made.

I may have been naive in thinking they could dye my hair , still they should have known if they could not dye my hair the desired color or not. I am now stuck with dark grey hair color when my hair had been a warm strawberry blonde color. Its not even a trendy shade of grey, it looks lifeless and dull. I even braught a sample of the color i wanted and my hair was already lifted. They diden't even want to give me a discount at first for the botched job. Wanted to charge me $229 , ended up having to pay $175 for a horrible dye job I am now stuck with. They blamed it on not being toned enough and that they could simply fix it with toner..clearly they have no clue how to dye hair.  Toner was not the issue, its the dye they used , the way it was dyed and the length of time the dye was on my hair that resulted in permanant grey color. I feel like i should have never gotten charged for this. What a rip off, the workers seemed like they knew what they are doing at first , but I should have known better..never again going back to this store. I am stuck wearing wigs and hair peices until I can lift this color out, which will not be easy because of how dark grey they made it.

1.0299282149580969e+20,Jenny Mattera,1555364208171,5,Chelsea at the salon in the Ulta Patchogue store is fabulous! She did an beautiful job on my 11 year old daughters hair! And my daughter has ALLOT of hair so it was no easy kid cut! It was my daughters first real haircut aside from getting it  trimmed so my daughter was a little nervous but Chelsea quickly made her very comfortable! She listened to what we were looking to achieve and was so pleasant and helpful and adviced us on how to keep the length but give her hair more of a style. And she nailed it! She is a very talented stylist! I will definitely be going back to her! And my 5 year old daughter wants her hair cut by Chelsea as well. It was so nice to see my daughter so excited after the haircut! She was immediately making videos and taking selfies! I can't thank Chelsea enough! 💜 I would definitely recommend Chelsea!,,,0x89e848fe64ce4f83:0x74857e8e3984210d

They literally have everything you need, want, desire, wish for, and wonder about in the beauty world of products. They have products not only for women but also for men in this store. So gentleman listen up the world of beautifying yourself is not only just for women. Men have grooming needs as well and Ulta is the one stop shop for name brands at a reasonable price and convenient location. Not only that if you use the Ulta Rewards Card you earn points for money off future purchases as well.
I highly recommend shopping here in the store or online with Ulta they have all the same name brands you find in department stores as well as the name brands you find in stores such as Walmart. Except with Ulta it's all under one roof and their sales associates are very knowledgeable and so super polite and friendly and always ready to assist you with anything you can think of asking.",,,0x89d6b17e57f4d7d7:0xa69b86a6b78554da

First she cut and colored my hair which was good. Then a couple of weeks later I was supposed to get a wavy perm and the stylist used the wrong size rollers and my hair came out all kinky. She knew she screwed up I could tell by the look on her face after she took the towel off my  head and while we were both looking in the mirror. My hair was smelly and like straw when I went to shampoo the next time and it continued for weeks after. She had burned my hair with over processing during the perm.

The store is beautiful and although I'm sure their job requires them to ""ask if I need help"" while watching for theft in this area. It really killed my experience, I wasnt able to walk 5 aisles before being cornered by 4 different people all in ears reach of the other, I just wanted to shop in ease. Everyone seemed very friendly and helpful but I just felt bombarded and unable to enjoy the 5 mins I did of browsing. I bought what I needed but intended on going over to the Mac section for liner, lipstick and blush but honestly just felt uncomfortable. This is not intended to get anyone in trouble they are doing their job but also it would be great if after the first no to needing help the people right there wouldn't ask the same question less than a minute later. I look forwards to going back again soon. It is great to know they are willing to help when needed but I don't like feeling surrounded especially when my purse has a front closure. There was nothing to be suspicious of, maybe they are trying hard because it's new but less is more. I just wanted to think, discover and enjoy.",,,0x89e85b0462c40323:0x58489e65d001255

I ended up buying mascara and a dark spot corrector which luckily was on sale. I went with my best friend and we were able to get all our questions answered without feeling pressured to buy anything.

It's a nice alternative to Sephora especially for hard to find items and drug store brands to do a proper comparison. All in all a great experience.","[{'url': array(['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS7gTPc-AXDJkyPDJr-4b8kTvE5bHNrkxsB3Jr=w150-h150-k-no-p'],

I always have a great experience at this location. But today I had a cashier named Fabiola be very prejudice and bias towards me. I had two returns, both with receipts, one order consist of nail polishes and the other was a hair serum. She asked me if I used the polishes and I said no I just ordered online because they didn’t have the promotion gift in store and she literally checked my nails to see if the polish I was wearing was the same and when I dipped my card she questioned me multiple times was it the same card on the receipt-which it was. Then we moved on to the second return which was a serum with an email receipt. She refuses to scan the code and has me read it to her and then says Im over the return period I can not return so I say ok and proceed to put the item back in my bag. She then says to me “Oh were you meaning to buy that?” Um excuse me? The same item I just showed you the receipt for and you asked me what day I purchased and all the info that was on the receipt you just looked at. I work in Sephora so im very aware that they train employees to be prejudice against blacks and other groups and people who come in in groups and with families but she needs a write up or something for that very non sensible prejudice and bias behavior. I decided to take the better route then schooling her for treating me in such manner. But please check your employees, train them better or fire them because the next person might not be so nice and it seems this is something she does since she was so comfortable in providing that style of service and that is also a reflection of the company and horrible training.",,"{'text': ""This isn't what we want to hear, Tina.

We all have to start somewhere, but not a good thing in this case. It was September 2017, it was warm and sticky outside. The stylist was hot, so she turned a little fan on. Bc of that fan my hair didn’t lift in a very obvious place (right by my face!). When I called to have it fixed I had to work around her schedule, very inconvenient for me! Finally met up to have it fixed, and it was still darker than the rest of the hair...  luckily for me that stylist no longer works at this salon, still with Ulta though.

1.1602014125509978e+20,Brooke,1547323197488,1,"Disgusted by the way I was treated by the employee Monique. Booked a brow appointment for 2:20 I show up 10mins before my time. I go to the brow area, which (by the way when I made the appointment I was given no instruction on where to go) and asked an employee named Monique for help since I have an eye appointment. She rudely asks me ""we'll, did you book an appointment, or?"" and stares at me like I have 8 heads. So at this point I'm just ready to leave, but give her the benefit of the doubt. I tell her ""yes I made an appointment "". She stares like I'm bothering her, so I tell her it's with a woman named Charizma. So she looks over and sees she is finishing up with a client. She tells me she'll be right with me. So I browse around near the brow bar so they can let me know when its my turn. I find some product for purchase and I look at the time. It's around 2:38 and I look over and there's a different client in the chair. So I see Monique and ask her what's going on with my appointment. I let her know I noticed a different person in the seat and wondered what was going on and why I wasn't informed it was my turn. She again rudely asks if I booked the appointment and I just tell her ""yes"". I'm now getting frustrated because she already knew that I booked the appointment so what was the reason behind asking again if I already said yes. She goes and gets the book to ""verify"" I booked the appointment. She sees that I did and says that it's been double booked like I was the one making appointments. She pauses and said I could either wait ANOTHER 20mins or re-book for another time. In conclusion I left extremely dissatisfied and upset. I didn't even purchase my products I picked out and told Monique I won't be back unfortunately. I'm writing this in hopes to make the customer service experience at this location a little more pleasant for customers like me. The lack of communication between employees and customer interaction is missing the mark in my opinion. I could go down the list of the things that could have been done differently to make my experience better but also, one employee lost a client for the day.",,,0x8854b48a4fb234e9:0x9905f1bbdb285b3e

Lady said "" no, I will use all the points and you will have some left over, you are covered"". You new total is 20$.
How was it 20$ if I had a 125$ reward and only spend 120 today?
Well because she doesn't know how to do her job, after calling customer service I found out that the answer to my original question was yes.
Yes you have to spend 125$ or more to redeem 2000 points, which meant that I just lost 20 of points and paid 20$ extra on top of that.

What a joke, everybody who works at the register should know basic policy.
People spend 2,000$ just to get 2000 points the least you could do is not waist our money !

THEY GAVE ME A FULL SIZE ITEM WHEN I ONLY PAID FOR A TRIAL SIZE ITEM. Worst part... I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THE ITEM BUT THE CASHIER TOLD ME THERE WASN'T A WAY TO CANCEL IT. SHE MADE ME PICK UP THE ITEM WITH MY OTHER PICK UP ITEMS JUST TO LATER BE TOLD BY A NICE MANGER AT THE STORE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN CANCELED FROM THE PICK UP ORDER. SO I GO TO RETURN IT ON 10/13/2020... A DIFF. DAY FROM THE ORIGINAL PICK UP DAY SINCE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PROCESS THE SAME DAY RETURN... & THE CASHIER ONLY FINDS THE TRIAL SIZE ITEM TO RETURN BUT WHOEVER PICKED AND BAGGED THE ORDER, PUT THE FULL SIZE ITEM IN THE BAG. NOW I HAVE TO WAIT FOR A MANAGER WHO IS TAKING FOREVER TRYING TO LOOK UP ANOTHER CUSTOMERS ORDER. I AM RETURNING AN ITEM I WON'T USE... JUST TO FIND OUT I GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL ON IT & SHOULD JUST KEEP IT BUT I ALREADY DROVE TO THE STORE ON MY DSY OFF. NOW WHILE I'M WAITING ON THE MANAGER TO FINISH WITH HER CUSTOMER UP FRONT, I WENT TO LOOK AT THE CHI LAVE CURL SHOT.. CURLING IRON. A $129 CURLING IRON! I DON'T SEE IT ON DISPLAY WITH THE OTHER IRONS SO I ASKED THE OTHER MANAGER THAT WAS OUT ON FLOOR. (MEDIUM/LONG DARK BLACK HAIR MANAGER). I BELIEVE THE NICER MANAGER THAT WAS UP FRONT WAS A BRUNETTE.. ANYWAYS, SHE SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE IT OUT AND SHE HELPS ME OPEN THE BOX SO I CAN LOOK AT IT. AGAIN.. THIS IS A $129 CURLING IRON! NOT CHEAP! THE MANAGER OPENS THE BOX, SETS IT ON THE TABLE AND *HOLDS ON TO THE BOX.. THE ENTIRE TIME I'M LOOKING AT IT AND TRYING TO TAKE IT OUT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I TOLD THIS RUDE LADY ""OK, THANK YOU"" . MEANING YOU HELPED AND NOW YOU WALK AWAY... SINCE STANDING OVER THE CUSTOMER AS THEY SHOP IS OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO MAKE FOR A GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. I MEAN SHAME ON A CUSTOMER FOR WANTING TO TAKE THE PRODUCT OUT AND KINDA GET A FEEL FOR IT. THIS IS NOT A REGULAR CURLING WAND. I HAVE PLENTY OF WANDS BUT I DON'T HAVE A HORIZONTAL ONE LIKE THE CHI LAVA CURL SHOT. SHE WAS SO RUDE! SHE SAID SHE WAS HOLDING IT TO MAKE SURE THE CORD DIDN'T COME OUT! NEW FLASH... EVERYONE THAT COMES INTO ULTA ISN'T A THIEF. I'M NOT GOING TO RUN OUT THE DOOR WITH IT!!! I DON'T STEAL! AND I CERTAINLY DON'T APPRECIATE BEING STOOD OVER WHILE TRYING TO SHOP AS IF I'M A THIEF!!!!!! And this is not the 1st time I have felt like a thief shopping here. Asking a customer if they're still doin ok  while they shop is fine but if there are several other customers in the store and you ask one customer 3-4 times if they need help, it begins to feel like your overly focused on that 1 customer. If I can't shop in piece & look at ingredients on the bottles while shopping for a new shampoo without being made to feel like a thief... I'll buy the products in target, kroger and/or Meijer.. since they now carry most of the same products!",,"{'text': ""We're sorry to hear that you were disappointed by your visit with us.

I wasn't in a hurry and so I wandered and looked around. I tried to catch 3 different employees while browsing and some of them looked at me but rushed away. Finally I caught an employee and she acted like I was pulling her way from something more important. Im spending a decent amount of money so I would like to feel good about the types and colors of makeup im choosing.
I have had a similar job, I understand sometimes there are lots of things to do. BUT I was taught that you ALWAYS stop what you're doing to help a customer and to make them feel like they have your complete attention ..unrushed, friendly and helpful. This is the 3rd time I have felt disappointed by Ultas employees.

Two stars for good product.

I was then informed they don't even carry that line, so I was pretty peeved that I spent all that time waking around, with multiple products in hand for nothing.",,,0x883093a060f7b667:0x7752359bf2238c48

I felt that if I LIKED beauty supply stores, I'd probably think this one was great. The place has a lot. A LARGE variety of brands & supplies. It's a large store, but doesn't feel warehousey. It's very trendy & chic.

The employees were engaging but not pushy. They were helpful even on silly requests & questions I had on my meager purchase of hair ties & clips. As just mentioned, even I found something that I liked and was comfortable with buying. I don't know that I'll be back with my minimal beauty needs to buy hair bands & clips, but if you like eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, lotions, facial skin care, curling irons, and other beauty supplies, you might wanna stop in & see what they've got. They're a really stellar store with great employees.",,,0x883093a060f7b667:0x7752359bf2238c48

Was told by one of them to look on the back wall. The place is huge! There is so much product there I had no idea where to look on the back wall! As I walked away to let them continue their personal conversation,  the one yelled to me her ""favorite "" brand. Couldn't find any glosser and gave up and left. Not one of atleast 6 employees I passed as I walked out asked if they could help me. Went right next door to Sally's and was greeted as soon as I walked in and taken over to what I was looking for.

1.08474072699527e+20,Angelina Hernandez,1489499239704,2,"Let me just say, the only reason this review has 2 stars is due to the fact that Ulta has such a wide variety of makeup. I visit different locations frequently. The other day I stopped into this particular location for the sale they had adverised via email. Excited, I took time to look around the store, hoping to find a full coverage foundation.  When I asked an employee if they carried the Cover FX brand, she rolled her eyes at me and said No, turning her head. For atleast 20 minutes I waited in the store, hoping to for an employee to point me in the right direction of which product to buy. No one ever approached me. Two employees were standing around, not doing much. As I turned to leave, frustrated, the manager was near the front door, patting down an employee, checking her pockets, and even had her open her wallet, going through it . She did this infront of a atleast 10 customers. The poor girl laughed, completely embarrassed. This is illegal. So, I asked her a question, pulling her away from the employee, hoping to save the poor girl from any further embarrassment, and finally get help. The manager did help with choosing a foundation, but chose one that they did not have all of the shades in stock. I chose a shade closest to my skin tone, and left as soon as possible.
Women shopping for makeup hope to be greeted kindly, and helped. The service at this location is atrocious. I will make the extra drive to shop at a different location, or simply shop at Sephora!",,,0x883093a060f7b667:0x7752359bf2238c48

There's one employee in particular, she might even be a manager, (UPDATE: her name's Hannah, stay clear of her) she answers your questions like you're dumb, she never makes eye contact when she's talking to you and she has given me false information on a few occasions for example, when Ulta recently had their Tarte event I asked if they had any flyers with info for the event & she responded with her snotty voice ""no we don't have any flyers"" answering me like I should have known that they don't provide any info for the event (which I thought was weird). I asked her how the event worked, if we just sit and watch Tarte makeup artists do a models makeup to learn new tips and tricks and she said yes. I wanted to make sure that by signing up to come to the event that didn't mean that I would be getting a makeover. She said no by signing up that didn't mean that I would be getting my makeup done. So the day came, I walked in, and sure enough, by signing up it meant I would be getting my makeup done. Here I am with a full face of makeup because I thought we were going to be watching Tarte makeup artists do a models makeup...not mine. & the icing on the cake, the ""Tarte makeup artists"" were just Ulta employees. So I ended up having an employee do some eye makeup on me, which was pretty at first but once she added the winged eyeliner, it looked pretty bad. Also, the lip color she used on me was wayyyy to dark for me & didnt look good at all. I was embarrassed of my makeup and went home and washed it all off. Never again will I go to an Ulta event.","[{'url': array(['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGz5WwNBwXwU7lmoRDZyhQRMNEzTMJzICqgcpE=w150-h150-k-no-p'],

1.0902942556199944e+20,Brittany Pfabe,1523288117292,1,"I only rated this 1 star because it wouldn't let me go any lower. My roommate and I went into this location on a Sunday afternoon because i had a gift card to spend. NEVER again will I return. First, we started out at the concealer. There was two sale signs, one for 50% off, and one for buy two get one free. We were both confused so we asked a employee. She looked at both the signs & also didn't know herself. Then finally found out... the 50% off sale ended two days prior. The employee just walked away, LEAVING THE EXPIRED SIGN UP! Not thinking much of it, I finished my shopping. Went to the Yes To face care line. Face wipes were 50% off, so I grabbed a pack. So we moved on to the Not Your Mother's hair line. There was HUGE sign proclaiming 50% off of their products. THEN even listed out each product under the 50% off sign. So I grabbed what I needed & headed to the register. Not paying any attention (my fault) the cashier rings up my items & I pay. My roommate is now checking out & notices that the Not Your Mothers line is ringing up incorrectly. She politely says that the Not Your Mothers line is supposed to be 50% off per sale sign. She cashier has a blank look on her face and shrugs her shoulders. My roommate took her to the sign where it was in HUGE BOLD LETTERS 50% off & even listing out the products. The cashier simply said... ""Oh that's just listing the products that they make,  the only one that is on sale is the original dry shampoo."" VERY MISLEADING!!!! It didn't say that ANYWHERE! The cashier did not apologize for the misleading sign or anything. She seemed very annoyed she even had to go back there and look. So back to the register to ring up the rest of the items. Big Sexy Hair had a powder play that was originally 17.99 but was on sale for 10.99 (RIGHT UNDER THE PRODUCT WAS THE SIGN FOR THE SALE.) What do you know... it rang up as 17.99!!. At that point my roommate was fed up and didn't want anything! The cashier said NOTHING - and just took it all off the order. No apologies, no honoring the CORRECT ADVERTISED price, just a blank face.   THEN - I had her refund my Not Your Mothers products (because they apparently weren't on sale EVEN THOUGH the sign said they were) & mentioned to her about the  Yes To face wipes. At this point the manager was up front with the cashier. I explained that the Yes To wipes were supposed to be 50% off. The manager rudely said "" Is the sale supposed to be for this size?!"" I Said, i'm not sure it just said wipes?! She did not even respond & grabbed their newspaper to look up if it was on sale. At that point I said forget it, Take it all off I don't want it! Then she said (non-apologetic) ""well i can fix the face wipes the sale started today"". I explained how upset I was to the cashier with the store & how absolutely NOTHING was marked correctly and she shrugged her shoulders again and said ""I mean, there is nothing I can do about it"" UM...HOW ABOUT MARK THE PRODUCTS CORRECTLY & KNOW THE ONGOING SALES YOU HAVE SO YOU DON'T WASTE PEOPLES TIME! So we left the store & looked online at the website & no surprise the Big Sexy Hair powder play was marked on sale for 10.99 - just like we mentioned the sign said but didn't ring up correctly. We were not the only customers having this issue. While we were checking out - I over heard the customer to my right explaining to her cashier that the price of the product was incorrect. I can imagine this happens ALL DAY because no one seemed to know anything about the prices/sales going on.

So recap - This is the WORST store I have ever been in. I will not be surprised if this store goes out of business soon because of the rude employees, management & bad marketing.",,,0x8836d6ca1199fcd3:0xd173ea92aed2fd57

The CHI products are significantly less at other retailers that carry similar product lines, who are located either within the same shopping center or directly next door.

The customer service was unacceptable with the lack of product knowledge, to say the least. They would not price match or honor the online coupon of $10 off. They would only offer $3.50 off.

After the miserable experience at the store, I decided to try to purchase this product online to avoid returning to the store. Again, I was extremely disappointed to learn only one gift card can be used per transaction. I am trying to purchase a costly item with three gift cards plus my credit card and multiple gift cards cannot be used for a single transaction.

My frustration has only deepened with the negative interaction with Customer Service via the 866 number and their unwillingness to rectify the situation.

I don't think this company wants anyone's Christmas business. As I'm typing this, the $10 off online coupon has changed to $15 off, but I cannot use it because I have three gift cards!

Will never go back and don't recommend it to anyone. **update** don't let Lisa touch your hair, I went back today and the salon manager fixed my hair. She said the original cut was terrible, and that it looked like Lisa just grabbed my pony tail off and cut it off. The woman who fixed my hair was amazing, and I left today feeling a little bit prettier than I had when I walked in, but I'm still horrified that I look manish.",,,0x883884f2d74bacb5:0x6e75affcc84a72ac

1.1501840686315869e+20,Amber Wright,1510510957185,4,"First let me start off by saying i am in no way a girly girl. I struggle with makeup, and it dosent help that i have oily skin plus large pores. I had gone in once before and liked there stuff but was a little worried about price. Went in a few weeks later ( with some extra cash) and ended up getting almost 200 dollers worth of stuff. I was only going to get like 2 things till i found out that you can return for any reason. A big reason why i had never got into makeup is that i have VERY pale skin ( to put into terms, i had to get my foundation in the tone snow lol) and its hard to find items that work well with that. After finding out there return policy tho i said y not?? My only downside ( and why i dident give 5 stars) is that i had to track someone down to get suggestions on makeup, they kinda avoided me. I found out later the girl who was working that area thought i had already been helped, she then showed me multiple items i could use and also did a color match for me. Which was nice because she accutly works for a diff brand then i was looking at ( i try to do crulty free brands) so all in all great place and i will be back :)
Update: went back a few times.. Had horrible experience both times! Have contacted them a few times about it and they would fix it but I'm done.. The one in Pickerington is alot better and not rude. Started going to sephora and they are so much better !",,,0x883884f2d74bacb5:0x6e75affcc84a72ac

The girl working didn’t greet me, looked at me multiple times but didn’t ask if I needed any help (even though I was pacing the aisles looking for others to compare), and went up to one of the mirror and started touching up her makeup. I felt purposely ignored. I eventually went to the check out and bought the only brand that I could find. I’m very frustrated with her rudeness and judgemental attitude.

And there is this little 'spot' for men products, which was a bit disappointing. I figured they would have more than just cologne... maybe I was just not looking hard enough. Staff was courteous and polite, but EVERY aisle I go I would be asked if I needed help---which I did, I'm not going to lie.  But everyone was aggressively out there trying to help me.  Not sure why...felt a little uneasy.  1 star deduction because they did not have what I was looking for, another star deduction for the uneasiness.",,"{'text': ""Hi Don, we always want our guests to feel comfortable when they shop with us, so we're sorry to hear this about your visit.

First I couldn't find a few items and no one was around to help.  Once I did find someone no one wanted to bother.  Then at the cashier I was being ringed up she tells me I've been pre-approved for their credit card.  I'm like no thank you.  She goes on and on about it.  I continue to say No.  Then I'm like I am going to buy a house next year I don't want credit injuries on my report.  She's like it won't.  I'm like every time you put a new account you get dinged.

I needed one of the make-up artists help on what I should get to contour (I’m just now learning to contour) I got help from seriously THE BEST! Her name is Bridgett Stewart. I’ve never had a make-up artist actually help me so much. She didn’t just try to sell me anything and everything, she actually cared about showing me what products I actually need, that will actually work for my skin tone and teaching me what I needed as far as products to help me learn to contour, but not just that, I was using the wrong color foundation (I was using a powder because nobody in the past could help me with finding a light weight liquid foundation that actually looks good!) Bridgett took her time, actually CARED about what I needed and took her time to teach me how to do my make-up! I’ve never had that experience before. I did end up getting a lot of products, but I was so excited for my new products and brushes! Because I trusted her and everything she said I needed. By the end she had done my full face, and I like a more natural look, and I looked beautiful!!!!!!!!!!! And now at home, with all my new products and brushes, I’m practicing and learning how to do my makeup like Bridgett did for me! The past few times I’ve been to Ulta I’ve left with extremely pricey foundations, that are sitting on my vanity because they don’t work for my skin tone.  (the stuff I got at Ulta from Bridgett, I use all of them!!!!) I just want to say how appreciative I am for Bridgett and the time she took to answer ALL my questions and being so patient since I am such a rookie at doing my make-up! She also does weddings, proms, special events, ect. I have a photo shoot coming up and I’ll be calling Bridgett to do my makeup for it!","[{'url': array(['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk2Cd0x6t3tfPQvz7I7jxX9SNEurvdYKPT9hyy=w150-h150-k-no-p'],

Every time I shop here, I usually check products online first to make sure they are available in store. But when I got there, the staff usually said “everything we have are on the shelves”, but at different locations, they always took the keys and check inside the drawers.
When I checked out, I know for sure that the product I bought have gift with purchase, but nobody ever said anything, I always have to ask them, and there always a NO, “WE DON’T HAVE ANY”. I also asked like, do you have any perfume sample today for me to try ? “NO, WE DON’T HAVE ANY”.....
I rather to drive to Ulta Tulsa (the location next to Nordstrom Rack to be exact), the staffs there are always above and beyond. I never have to ask but they asked me instead about if I want any sample today. or they just gave me a lot of mini gift every time I checked out, even with small purchases sometimes.

1.097756745603839e+20,Shawna Vessey,1527271533989,1,"I have never had a worse experience any where in my entire life. After booking my appointment and calling to confirm time and services I show up at scheduled appointment time. A rude girl at the counter sits me in a chair and tells me my stylist will be right with me. Thirty-three minutes later I am finally spoken to by my stylist (no introductions made, I still don't know her name) and directed to sit in a salon chair and explain what I want done. After showing her and watching her facial expressions in the mirror it is clear that something is wrong. She stammers that she just doesn't have the time alotted to do my hair. Even though from the time I confirmed to the time I show her...NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Except of course that I'm at this point FORTY minutes into my slotted appointment time and she hasn't touched my hair. She tells me she can do a cut and put some color on my hair (UH HUH sure that sounds appealing) but she went longer and has another appointment and just doesn't have time for my scheduled appointment. I have a graduation to attend and wanted my hair to look nice. Thanks (insert sarcasm) ULTA for seriously messing up this experience and also for costing me half a day's pay to sit in your uncomfortable waiting chair.",,,0x87b68bb35d59b4e1:0x9ef0e703a52d6f22

Especially when you're around the samples.  It's kind of odd where is you would think. They'd see an opportunity like oh she has a clean canvas to do demonstrations on or recommendations versus I love your eyeshadow thats already applied. I don't know it's just weird any other Ulta or Sephora I've ever been in they tend to kind of cater towards the people that don't have any makeup on or look lost. so that way they can make more sales and recommendations. I know a few girls who have left there because nobody really helped  them yeah they greeted them and thats about it. But to me personal Beauty and cosmetics is a passion and I'd want every woman to feel as beautiful as they possibly can, not just make that sell but to justify and help somebodys self-esteem and educate them on some of the products.  Enid just needs to step up their game with being involved with customers.",,,0x87afd258ceccdb0d:0x182166c80c81a863

I was helping my brother move that day no makeup hair pulled back w/jeans and t-shirt so I was stopping by b4 I went home about an hour south of Enid knowing I don't get to the city often. When I walked in everyone looked but not a single hello or offer of help as I was looking for my first set of makeup brushes. No one spoke tio me until I finally got to checkout and it was a quick  check out and I left. Ulta come on u need to step up ur employees! Discussed with your service.

I just had to add to this review. I’m 50 and decided to try Botox for the first time. Unfortunately I hated the results, in my forehead-In my opinion, my eyebrows got lifted to an odd looking place as a result. I feel like I resemble a soap opera villain, lol. Danielle -who is so talented- helped me get through this embarrassment by reshaping my eyebrows just enough to make it look less cartoonish!! I’m so grateful and so luckily!! My vanity and insecurities are now back in check. It’s nice to have someone who goes above and beyond for me. She also has great advice and helps me pick out products that work so well for me. Although I only met her through the benefit brow bar, I feel like I’m visiting with a friend. I used to go sporadically at different locations, but now, I’d follow her anywhere!!

My first issue was over a year ago, I had purchased a silicone eyeshadow applicator which never made it into my bag. Instead of just believing me they said they needed to look at the video footage of the day that I purchased the eyeshadow applicator.  I never did hear back about the lost eyeshadow applicator and I never did get my money back or the eyeshadow applicator.  In March 2021 I got a haircut and my brows shaped.  My haircut looked really cute after it was styled.  Once I got home and washed it the next day I realized it was a hot mess.  The front on the left side was 2 inches longer than the right side.  This was not part of the intended style.  My eyebrows were done to perfection.  On the plus side I have found an ULTA cream eyeshadow that I really like.  I have since lopped off the extra 2"" on the left side to make it even with the right side.  I'm sure they have good stylists and maybe it was just not a good day for mine, but I won't be going back to find out if it was a fluke.",,"{'text': ""We always want our guests loving their hair after they visit us for a salon appointment, so we're truly sorry to hear this, Carrie.

I specifically went in without makeup because I thought it would be easier for someone to help me find a good shade.

Well, it was very difficult getting any help (maybe I wasn't ""made-up"" enough to look like a serious customer with money burning a hole in my pocket?). When someone finally did help me, they appeared to be in a big hurry to find one shade in one product line and send me off with samples as quickly as possible.

When I wanted some more samples to try at home (because clearly I wasn't going to get much help trying things on in the store), I was told there is a 3-item limit on samples.

When I, as a customer, feel like I'm disturbing the salespeople, it doesn't make me want to shop there or spend money there.

Ulta and Macy's both have friendly service, but the men's cologne area in Ulta smelled pretty strong of all the fragrances so it was difficult to isolate the scent of the cologne I was trying. A comment from the associate helping me made a comment that I interpreted as this being a common obstacle. Further, their selection seemed more limited than Macy's, but they had 2 I liked and I got them. Also, I like to get the balm of the cologne I get, and they didn't have any for any of the fragrances I would have opted for. As a result, while they were nice, I think I'll choose Macy's in the future.",,"{'text': 'Hi Timothy, Thank you for sharing your experience.

I found staff a bit too pushy. I understand it is their job, but I don't want someone pushing me quite so hard. I obviously don't wear makeup, so they should realize they're wasting their time on me.

Most stuff is pricey, but there is a section of makeup which is very affordable and I actually got some mascara.

So much to choose from, and tons of skin care products you can try. That is kind of nice.

Hair supplies are crazy expensive.

I enjoy this store for many reasons and have been shopping at one particular location for years that they all know me there! I have enjoyed other locations, but the one I frequent is closest to me.

So, I have told you that the associates know me; but alone with their friendly disposition, they are knowledgeable professionals, they are well-trained, the products range from drug store affordable to high-end prestige, so it's something for every budget. Also, as a regular customer I enjoy soooooo many great perks, but the average random customer can enjoy great free gifts, opportunity to test & try products in-store, and so much more!! They also have a brow center, beauty salon, and even a facial salon. You must come see for yourself!

The girl slathered my face with petroleum jelly (which broke me out for a week after, and I do NOT break out usually), and then she dyed my brows about four shades darker than what I asked. I wanted a medium brown, and I left with black brows, Vaseline all over my face, and dye smeared all over my forehead and eyelids. I wanted to cry. All in all, if you are looking for a pleasant experience or any makeup advice, don't bother going to this store. The associates don't care about helping you unless you're purchasing prestige brands and the service providers don't know what the heck they're doing. Shame.",,,0x88f8aa49f6a6da93:0xf5337c4e9e42e4b8

The store manager also stated that anyone who needs to make a return may not do so without opening an ulta rewards account if they don't already have one.

I already disliked this company due to poor customer service and long waits to check out while they enroll customers in the rewards program and now they seem to have a return policy that violates privacy.

The manager actually had the nerve to try to tell me walmart requires the same thing when I literally made a return at Walmart 20 minutes earlier with NO questions asked. Nothing required aside from my receipt and a signature - as it should be.

I left the store empty-handed. As I was leaving the cashier said ""have a nice day""  She could have asked me if I found what I was looking for but that would have taken too much effort and she clearly wanted to get back to her conversation with the other cashier. My point is, If the product is going to be that expensive, someone should be there to tell me why it's worth that price. I drove all the way over there and left disappointed.
I guess I'll go to Belk                Update to owners response: They were perfectly able to assist me, they just didn't want to stop their own conversation with each other to do so.

This Ulta carries MAC as well as some of the newer brands, which is great if you're interested in trying something new. The prices are reasonable depending on what you're looking for. Personally, I love the fact that they have a well stocked ""drug store section"" where you can purchase cosmetics for a reasonable price. As well as a high end section where you can purchase items that you're willing to spend a little more on. Not only has this Ulta been well stocked, it's clean.

But some people are just careless and make a mess. Which is unfortunate. But the staff at this Ulta does a really great job at keeping up with everything. BTW, if you're looking for a stylists, ask for Jacklyn. I've been to a few places since moving here 5 years ago, and she's one of the best. I'm also a former stylist.

I went in and was greeted by an employee and I explained what I needed. She showed me where the cologne was and then began to walk off. I asked again for help before she walked off and I was sort of more direct this time in asking what type of fragrance I was looking for. She told me what was popular, nothing really about a specific product, and she started to walk off again. I then called out again before she left to ask about where the hair products were. She walked me over to them and then left. I felt really out of place already since this store is mainly geared towards female products, but this made it even worse. I came to this store hoping to get expert help and advice on my questions but I guess you don't get that here as a guy. In the time I was there searching Google for my questions because I didn't get any help, I saw multiple associates helping other customers who happened to be female, but actually helping them, staying with them, and talking about the products. I don't know if the person working with me was just having an off day, and I would totally understand, or if this is just the mentality of the entire store/Ulta.

The last time I came in I was looking for an SPF additive for my foundation/moisturizer. I remembered seeing it at the Ulta on Hulen, but went to this location because it's closer to my home. I saw two employees who were speaking to each other about the sales floor. I apologized for interrupting their conversation and asked if they could help me find the product. One of them rolled their eyes at me and said they didn't think they carried any sort of item that I mentioned. They tried to continue their conversation without letting me respond and asked if they were sure because I saw it at a different Ulta, unfortunately I just didn't know the brand. They said they had no idea. No suggestions, no asking other colleagues, nothing.

Now, I understand not having the item that mentioned, but the person who rolled their eyes was uncalled for. I ended up leaving and going to the Hulen location. The employees there were super helpful and I found my product from their Ulta! It is the ""CoverFX SPF 30 booster drops.""

I went in on 5/17 at around 7 pm to buy a new foundation. When I walked into the store, I greeted the employees, not the other way around. Walked around the store... Nature called, so I went to the restroom, came back out, and a security guard stopped me and another Black woman in the middle of store. He said to us both: ""Someone is looking for one of y'all.""

Both of us responded in confusion, as we had no idea what he was talking about. I went back to swatching foundations, but every aisle I went to lo and behold, Mister Security Guard is walking behind me.

Then I did one day and fell in love with the place. Each time I purchased products I would receive samples of other products to try. I tried everyone of them and if I liked it I went back and bought it. It was great! Nowadays you can’t get any samples even if you ask nicely for them. It’s like they are so selfish with samples. So I don’t try new products and in return don’t buy them either. Yesterday this place was out of everything. It’s like the day after Christmas event where they had a massive sell and sold out of everything. That’s how empty their shelves were yesterday. Did you fire your purchasing manager or what??

I was looking at lipstick and this older staff member accused me of smearing lipstick on my hand because she saw lipstick on my hand already,  which was from TESTERS a few minutes before. When I denied she just repeated herself and walked away. For the next 20 minuets she followed me around and watched me non stop like I was some kind of criminal. I do NOT like this, and I don't plan on going back. From the other reviews I see I'm not the only one having problems with the staff. I suggest you fix your staffs rudeness ulta.",,,0x864e794e3801c82f:0x8702030325ab5c28

This last try go-around, I was using The Ordinary brand which left me with embarrassing bumps and lesions on my face. It was humiliating to even show my face, and I didn’t even want to try anything new because I was so fed up.
Adrian helped me out at this location with such a beautiful and helpful personality. He didn’t try to pass judgment on my issue, but instead was extremely understanding. He sold me products based on his personal experience and knowledge with them rather than trying to sell me the most expensive products. I really appreciated how educated he was, and the fact that he didn’t BS me in anyway - just told me the truth.
I haven’t had the chance to try these products yet to see how well they work for me, but even after this one interaction, I can trust to go back to this Ulta to see Adrian for any more issues I might have! I found his demeanor to be incredibly comforting.

I showed her a pictures of highlights which colors were copper with low lights blonde well I walked out with RED hair. Then told her I wanted a hair cut with layers well my hair was just CHOPPED looked like my 14 year old gave me a haircut. I was devastated and overwhelmed and was about to just breakdown 😢 I know its just hair but the fact that I was there for almost 6 hours and plus my hair is ruined was too much for me. Thankfully Kelsey ended at least fixing the haircut and she gave me exactly what I had asked for. The GM was EXTREMELY nice and caring which made me smile, even though my hair color is still ruined, and I have to wait for at least 6 months to avoid damage for a redo. I would highly recommend Kelsey for your hair needs.

When you purchase merchandise they will immediately debit your card the amount of the purchase.  If you return the item at a later date, even if you have your receipt, they will not give you cash back on your DEBIT CARD purchase.  Instead they will credit that money back to your card AFTER THREE BUSINESS DAYS.

So when it's their turn to get money they take it before you can walk out the door with your purchase.  When it's your turn to have your money returned to you, you have to give them back your purchase then wait until they are good and ready to give your money back to you.

The staff itself was neither helpful or not helpful... but it was at the end of the day and getting late so I feel the need to cut them a little slack. From experience I know retail can be a tough job and understand at the end of the day you just want to get home.

#1. They have EVERYTHING beauty there! Seriously! Lots to choose from! I specifically go for my Clinique stuff cuz they're a legit distributor. I expect to full strength products when I pay extra for the brand name mech.! I've heard of fakes out there just recently and I won't do that! Too much to ask? Oh nay, nay! Ulta delivers that!
#2. They carry Clinique! Especially if you can't wait the time you'll wait for the website to get it shipped to you and it arrives.
#3. I love the perfumes there! Quality brand perfumes with a massive selection. Also, scattered bowls of coffee beans to ""cleanse  your senses from so many scents! 2x 👍!
#4. Several locations in my area. Makes it more convenient. Especially in an emergency! And the app seems pretty good so far. I just started that.
I don't like how steep the prices are for SOOO much of the stuff! They've  always had several if not alot of customers in the store I usually go to so business has been pretty good it seems. And really, everything has gone up in price recently across the world! Sign of the times I guess.
So 4 stars for me unless and until prices become more accessable to all woman! It just seems greedy to me! I don't like that!",,,0x874d9afa7e46e697:0xaf5ba3db378a2e4c

My last visit I initially went in for an eye cream but for the fun of it thought I'd ask an employee for recommendations for either a shampoo or conditioner or product to help with static hair. I have dealt with static hair my entire life and have tried a million different products and wasted money on ""recommendations"" from several hair stylist as well as the internet with no luck.

I asked her if she could just cut it then. she said she could and proceeded to do so.

It was uneven she never even offered to wash it I had asked her to wash the clippings out after she was finished cutting. That never happened.  Then she charged me $30 for the haircut and I had to stand in line for nearly 10 minutes to pay that ""at the front of the store. You'll find it.""

I browsed around the store for a bit trying to find what I wanted. After I couldn't find it, I asked for help from the first person I found and help is what I got.
There was no line at the checkout, a person who was running the cash register was friendly and nice.
I know nothing about makeup or beauty products. But the store is Big, had tons of stuff, seemed to be well organized. It wasn't difficult for me to find the nail stuff.
A lot of negative reviews so far but I didn't experience any of that. Perhaps a bit of a learning curve right after they opened?","[{'url': array(['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5kyeA8pJGb3cgk22b7Hu5ypHBdCY1U852yREt=w150-h150-k-no-p'],

I was SO happy when I discovered this store!!! It's beautiful inside, clean, great customer service. I felt their prices were fair on many products especially when so many are difficult to find elsewhere. Of course some you can find cheaper elsewhere, but this store carries products difficult to find. So they're TOTALLY worth it! Oh & they'll teach you how to do your makeup, you do have to book an appt & pay for it. I suggest googling prices, contrary to popular belief, they are NOT free makeovers, they DO charge & prices vary.
They have many sample products, makeup, skin care, perfumes, colognes, nail products, all natural products, etc. I give this store 5* they're totally worth it! If you're into beauty, this is definitely the store for you! ❤️",,,0x87547de81cc5a38d:0x146f73d65868b467

When I declined she seemed terribly inconvenienced. But if she had asked if I was interested in signing up, I might have said yes. Or minimum she wouldn't have wasted either of our time trying to force the reward program on me. Overall, will not return and will not be recommending. I don't appreciate my business being treated like an inconvenience especially when in the end it results in purchasing damaged product. with the current covid restrictions, they don't even want you touching samples.

Okay cool. Flat out said, hey I'm terrible at makeup could you help me find an everyday look, I'm sorry I don't know really anything. Was talking about whether I liked this or that... lady I just said I don't know anything how am I suppose to know what I like or don't like please explain. She showed me what she had on and walked away. No one else offered to see if i was okay. Got too overwhelmed, had anxiety attack, and had to leave frustraited and defeated. I know I dont know makeup, I know it looks bad as a 22yr old, I know I dont have ""the look""... but please don't make me feel completely terrible about myself and make me hate myself more than I already do. That customer service was plain terrible... at least show me sympathy or explain to me...it took me months of wanting to go and finally want to look pretty... now I never want to go back from embarrassment.

Had questions about a few things. I was bounced from person to person, with no apparent reason, all while shopping in the same area, same brand. Selection is extremely limited within brands. Three of the 4 clerks had no idea what they were doing. I had to ask for a specific item that came as a bonus or I wouldn't have received it. The cloth shopping bags they give you are disgusting.

The staff make their way around the isles and ask if you need anything, but it did take some time before my companions were asked. I was not asked at all, despite my CLEAR ignorance toward any type of makeup application/purchasing and my lost wanderings throughout the store. The products tested nicely though, as evidenced by the photo. I highly recommend the exotic color powders. We left purchasing Bare Minerals foundation (which, as a gem  collector, I've heard good things about their gem dust-inclusion products) and a Kylie Lip Kit. 4 stars due to the lack of attention to my unknown wandering and the VERY potent (almost overwhelming) smell of permed hair.",,,0x8805428428e55f55:0x597ad5743f2d948a

But there are things you can’t find around here that they carry. The gentleman in the prestige area is VERY good at foundation matching. I’d give him a 5. He takes the time to completely remove a portion of your makeup and will try several shades on each side (or a shade on each side, he’s good at choosing). I’ve had people slap foundation on over your own makeup at this location!  Also, I’ve had K do a great job on my brows at the brow bar. Then I had M do it. She kind of butchered my brows. Even though I said not to take much off. Now I have to live with terrible brows for at least 6 months. I didn’t realize how bad they were until I got home.
