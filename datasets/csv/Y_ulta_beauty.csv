dKN5pfsZYMyNXw6QekuYrg,idP674ti6a8yg8z2xFcCgA,1.0,"I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier, one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was, ""What's your phone number?""  Really?  No ""hello"", have you found everything you were looking for?""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG, totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.  

I most likely will continue shopping there, but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!!",2017,AZ,Arizona,39.9871886,-75.4032012,Y,9

Jess was awesome, she did my hair exactly like I asked & didn't try to talk me out of anything (every stylist I go to try to talk me out of the cut that I want, and I've had the same haircut for 15+ years). I brought in pictures to show how I wanted my bangs & she cut them exactly the way the picture look.

nxNO7_6U2Nu90v0IdnEhIg,idP674ti6a8yg8z2xFcCgA,2.0,"Store is clean, organized, and somewhat well-stocked. What I mean by the latter is that while there are a lot of options for almost any beauty need, there was some bare shelf space where popular items had gone out of stock, particularly in hair care. I could have just caught them before they restocked, but that was my experience. Couldn't get things I went there to buy. 

I read all the unfortunate low-star reviews about the associates before my visit, but visited with an open mind. I was greeted when I went in (one of 2 customers that night). When I had questions, though, I had to go to the registers to ask, because no one was on the floor. Up front, the two associates were talking with one other customer...for a while. Annoying that they felt it appropriate that they both tend to her, and make me wait (I was pressed for time to get to another store before it closed). After a few minutes, one assoc took the customer off down an aisle, and the other remained. She did not approach me after watching me linger for a question all that time, which is not very professional. She was, however, more professional when I approached / spoke to her. 

I asked about availability of any Chanel and Lancôme products, which she said she hopes to be stocking soon. This was great news for locals like me, who don't want to trek to the mall. She said she has tons of customers requesting the two brands, and they should have both in a couple months. She said their Exton store has them, and it's just a matter of time before they do as well. I will check back, and hope to see them in stock soon!

Aside:
When I go to Lancôme at Nordstrom / Neimans (KoP), or call Lancôme's toll free number (800-526-2663), they pronounce it ""Lawn-comb"" but at Ulta, after I pronounced it that way, the associate made a point of saying ""Lan-come"" (like the a in ""land""), like I was in error. Just annoying when someone ""corrects"" me with their own mispronunciation. I don't really care how you pronounce it, but if you're going to ""toe-may-toe / toe-mah-toe"" me, I'll ""toe-may-toe / toe-mah-toe"" you back.",2018,AZ,Arizona,39.9871886,-75.4032012,Y,1

I walked in the other day and literally had three employees at the same time ask me if they could help me find anything. And they don't give up either.

The girls there were super helpful! They color matched me with a lightweight foundation after she did a section she went and did my full face and even did some concealer.

I have a credit card with Ulta and I'm also a frequent shopper so it's pretty frustrating and offensive to be treated this way.

Pros:
- Tons of selection at all price points
- Lots of coupons and a rewards program, I got a free tube of CK mascara for my birthday!
- Friendly staff whenever I have been here
- Salon with fair prices, haven't tried it yet but I hope to in the future. 

Cons:
- Tons of selection, it can be really overwhelming and staff to provide guidance tends to be minimal.
- Certain brands/styles can be really picked over and sometimes only a few colors are in stock for some brands and types.
- Color samples are hit or miss and can be really old and beat up looking sometimes, but i suppose this happens with destructive shoppers. Even non-sample products can be beat up, be sure to inspect before buying.",2014,AZ,Arizona,39.71344115,-86.35794724,Y,4

I wasn't even aware Ulta did facials until I checked out their beauty services online. Right now I am dealing with a few little breakouts that I'm trying to get under control, and found their facial to be fairly inexpensive at less than $50.

Ulta isn't a spa, so I didn't really know what to expect. I figured I would still gave it a chance because they offer 15% off for first-time skin and hair services customers. 

In the end, I would say that I was pleased with the results. Parise did my facial and she made me feel comfortable about everything she was doing. She explained what the products were and what they were for and also paid attention to the areas where I was having issues. The facial also did not involve extraction, which is a plus! Even without the extraction, I still felt like my pores were opened and cleansed. I think the only critical thing I can say is the area in the back of the store is not all that quiet, because there is no door and the salon is back there. So there is a bit of chatter in the back that took me out of the experience a few times. That said, it wasn't too loud, and at least there is a room you can be in to relax as you get your treatment.

I had my facial yesterday and I wanted to wait until today to give a review to see if the products she applied helped. They actually did! The breakout area on my face is reduced as of this morning.

bMGIATKbYqPu8lkyLirvBw,4uqRhXZTOzKF2ZhxbWzxfA,5.0,"Let me preface my review with this: I am very picky with who cuts my hair. I have trust issues.

Jaclyn is fantastic not only at curbing anxieties, but at cutting hair. My hair used to go down to the small of my back and I wanted to chop it to collar bone length, I was terrified! I had been growing my hair out for years, but I was looking for a change.

Jaclyn gave me her advice and opinion based on the shape of my face and did a wonderful job cutting it with the layering style I like.

A little later, I went back. I wanted to chop it again, this time to the length of my chin. Coming in riddled with anxieties, Jaclyn helped calm me and decide the logistics of the cut. She even remembered me! Similar to the first time I visited, I loved my hair coming out.

Jaclyn not only cares about her clients, but is extremely talented. I will only be seeing her for my haircutting needs in the future!",2020,PA,Pensilvania,39.6720582582,-75.6489002742,Y,1

Now, the haircut itself.... I had asked for a blunt cut, cutting the back of my head to match the length of my bangs. Blunt cut means All the hair is one length, no layers. After cutting my curls wet and combed straight she then fluffed pulled and and twirled my curls so it still looked blunt and even when I walked out but by the time I got home it was obvious she had not done what I had asked all, because the back is inches longer than the front. My hair is only barely shoulder length so it kind of looks like a mullet now that it's dry. 

I am really annoyed because she kept saying how easy of a request it was and how she didn't have to take very much off.... but she didn't do what I asked at all, as you can see in the photo that is NOT a blunt cut.

Brentwood at least always has plenty of employees who seem to spend their shifts talking to each other instead of customers. This one was pretty empty when I visited.

The only person helping customers was apparently the store manager. She was nice enough when I talked to her but I only got to talk to her after asking the cashier where to find something. 
I just don't get it. If I go into a Sephora, I immediately have a sales associate trying to help me no matter how dressed up or down I might be.  At Ulta, it doesn't seem like they care. Whether you're here to spend $10 or $100, they'll ignore you equally.

On several occasions, I've come in at fairly slow times and never been asked for help. As someone who works in retail, I know how important that is to sales, so it's surprising that management doesn't encourage customer engagement. 
One particular time, I came in looking for a specific hair tool. After circling the hair tool section about four times, I still couldn't find it and decided to ask somebody (because I had checked online and they said that they had the product in stock). I looked all around, and the only associates were either talking with each other or walking swiftly around. I decided to circle around a couple times, waiting for somebody to notice that I had been there for about 15 minutes now. The more I circled, the more annoyed I got. I decided to leave and go get my tool at the Walmart behind Ulta, which I found in less than 3 minutes of walking in.
Another time, the girl checking me out accidentally scanned the $50 palette I was purchasing twice and I didn't realize until after I got back to my car. When I returned, the girl looked annoyed and didn't offer any sort of apology as she refunded me. Once again, as somebody who works in retail, I can't understand the attitude she had with me and get annoyed that I didn't get an apology. Had I not noticed, I would have been charged $50!

I came into my noon appointment only to wait 45 min while Madison took in another client at MY appointment time. After my long wait, Deb sat me down and looked at my hair-- pulling and tugging on my ends. After examination, she decided it was far too ""damaged"" for her to do anything. She told me what I wanted done to my hair would look awful. Angry, I left and I am sure to never return. 

Interestingly, as I made an appointment with a REAL salon the next day, I got my hair done exactly how I wanted it and it turned out beautifully.

It is because they have so many phenomenal products in one place that it is too hard for me to resist.

I used to go to Macy's or Nordstrom's for all of my cosmetics like Lancôme, Clinique and all my perfumes but they have quite a selection in Ulta and they do take coupons if you get on their mailing list. They also have a rewards program.

If I run out of mascara, it is a lot easier to run in and grab it from Ulta Beauty than it is to park and walk through the mall where at times I end up spending more on clothes because I discovered a good sale.

Luckily, there was an immediate opening (and it was a Saturday late afternoon). I had never been to an Ulta salon before - just looked curiously at it while shopping. The salon workers all seemed pretty friendly. (Thought it was kind of weird that they all had randomly colored hair in pinks/blues/etc. I guess it is close to Easter time...maybe they were trying to market colored dyes?) My hairstylist was Felicia - she had blue tinged, long black hair. She was very nice, made conversation with me, gave me a bottle of water, listened to what I wanted and even recommended a tattoo artist when I asked her about her tattoos. My hair came out exactly how I wanted it (past shoulders, blunt cut with a few layers and some bangs - from all long layers). Then she blew dry it all sexy and ready to go out (too bad I was just going to run errands with the family). I will definitely go back to her again!  Price is probably average for a midrange salon. 

As for the retail side of it. I needed to get some foundation and was determined to get it as I had (also) put this off til the last minute. It took me FOREVER to get help. I walked around and around and around. There were salespeople helping others but also some that weren't who would walk right past me and ask someone else if they needed help (which they always did)! It was very frustrating! After at least 30 mins of this, I finally found a lady with a CK nametag on who said she could help me. She found me a foundation and I finally was able to get out of there.  Great place to get product - but make sure you know what you want before you go in or you may wait too long for help! Sephora and Ulta need to find their happy medium. Seems Sephora always has wayyy too many people wanting to help and Ulta has the opposite. (Which makes me want to go to Sephora for makeup instead.)",2015,AZ,Arizona,32.2201962748,-110.8650453822,Y,4

There was a line of customers so I waited til the line went down. Line went down, and I literally saw the cashiers just glance at me and pretend they didn't see me. I finally go up to a cashier with blond curly ombré blue hair to ask for help and this lady acted really snobby like I just ruined her day. I asked her if there were any more colors in the dermablend or the stilla foundation and she stated that dermablend is repackaging their product so she didn't know when they'd be stocked. So then she just looks at me. Ok, so I finally get her out from behind her register and she walks me over to stilla and points out their selections. I asked her for recommendations and what was comparable to the makeupforever foundation, and she told me that's at sephora and started to walk away. I asked her about the dermablend and she just sort of walked me over to the direction. Then she just kind of looked at me like she wanted a pat on the back for helping me.

It was a different girl with long brown hair (thank god) and I asked which matched me better and this lady actually helped me figure it out. So I went home and looked at my foundation in the mirror and it was way too light. Basically the whole trip was a waste of time. I couldn't even exchange the product even if I wanted to because they didn't have many in stock.

Instead she just did it and I found out once she handed me the bill. My hair looked hardly lighter since she put a dark toner over the highlights. Secondly, I noticed I had a ton of hair not in foils. Today I went into another salon and was told how she did not even remotely do full highlights.

I had a couple of problems using a coupon on the ULTA website (long story..the website simply would not let me use the coupon, no matter what I tried). So I brought the coupon with me into the store, and asked if there was any way I could use it there. Even though it was an online only coupon, the staff was sympathetic, and made sure that they found a way to give me the same discount. That was above and beyond the normal service level and very appreciated!

One of the girls also helped me choose a mascara, and she was very knowledgeable and friendly.

Suddenly the manager looks at our direction about 10 feet away and over the mic says ""help this lady""
I didn't react, just told the girl it was ok to go but then to think about it, that was rude ! Why couldn't she help her instead of adding this stress on her staff!

The woman repeatedly cut me off while talking, and upon telling me that it wasn't in stock, despite the fact that the website said it was, all that she had to say was 'bye.' She didn't ask if I had any more questions, she just hung up the phone. Another instance of bad customer service did not come from rudeness but from ignorance.

- sephora usually has a fuller staff to store and customer ratio. Sometimes so many that the look bored because the store is only so big
-ulta is the complete opposite, less staffed bigger store, more customers than availible sales associates... which all i have to say to that is..i get it!

Every time I try to go to this location, I'm horrendously disappointed. The check out line can be 2 people or 15 people but it will take you 30 minutes to get out of the store from the moment you get in line.

Every time I come in here the gals are always super kind. The Clinique gal helped me so much today and she was coming back and running to the cashe register and coming back to the Clinique area. She was doing her best while the store was unusually full . She did try to explain that they were short staffed today but these college girls were just annoyed that they had to wait in line and were being so rude. Even as I was checking out the girls were right in my space right In front of the debit card machine I had to ask one girl to move so I could pay. For being short staffed and putting up with all the attitude they get all day I'm amazed at how kind the employees are here. The gal named Celeste is always nice too. I feel that this store has bad ratings because we're near a college town and if they don't get help right away there quick to come on here and complain. I live about 6 minutes away and have frequented this store for years. It sucks that these college kids come in with their sorry attitudes and complain about everything.

I decided to browse while I wait. I noticed dirty/gross testers, no associates acknowledged me while I browsed, no one asked if I needed assistance or anything. 

Now I work in retail myself and I understand needing to get your job done with displays or whatever it may be. But really not even a ""Hello"" or a ""Can I help you?"" was said so it's just kind of appalling to see poor customer service. I walked through aisles looking at makeup while associates glanced over while continuing their project. 

I was testing makeup on the back of my hand and needed a tissue to wipe it off...I couldn't find a single stand w clean tissues or cotton. There were plenty of used cosmetic supply strewn on displays. It was really off putting. Makeup testers out or dried up/funky smells. 

I had a great experience last year I went there to get my nails done. The girl did everything you would do for a manicure. This time on the other hand was different. When I went in the other day, my nails came out looking like I had painted them quickly before I came into the salon. 

No soaking of nails to soften skin, no pushing back of cuticles..you know the regular routine of a manicure. I felt bad calling back because the the woman who did my nails was SUPER friendly and nice. We had a lovely conversation too. But I didn't feel like she knew what she was doing all the way. 

My nails look awful and I payed $40 total for them to look like I did It myself, which is the whole reason I go to get them done so they look nice. I don't know if I'll be coming back here for services.",2016,LA,Luisiana,34.42947658,-119.87175968,Y,3

I rarely write bad reviews, but this Ulta is just not the place to get a haircut. I am new to the area and so I got two haircuts at Ulta before deciding that the convenient location and low price wasn't worth it.

For both haircuts--with two different stylists--they told me that they ""preferred cutting dry"" and so didn't wash or blow dry my hair. This doesn't reduce the price, however, and I feel like it's just a convenient way for the stylist to get out of the time-consuming wash and blow dry. Also, on my first visit the stylist asked me if I wanted it straightened and since I do normally straighten my hair I said yes. When I went to pay I noticed she added a $10 charge to the bill! So, she didn't give me half of the haircut (the wash and blow dry) but added extra to the total price. 

For both haircuts I wanted a normal cut with long layers just to make it lay nicely, and both stylists did a crazy amount of layering in my hair that I definitely didn't ask for. The first stylist mentioned that I had a ""mom haircut"" and talked about all the crazy things that happen in IV where she lives. The second stylist told me that my side part looked like ""TV anchor hair."" Who are these people? 

Anyway, both haircuts left me feeling deflated so I finally found a new salon (Cutting Edge Hair Salon in Goleta) and I couldn't be happier.",2014,LA,Luisiana,34.42947658,-119.87175968,Y,9

Most annoying is this experience: they have been out of two very basic products, and in both situations, told me that they weren't getting anymore, and that the product had been discontinued by the manufacturer. I then went to Sephora, and they had the products and found it odd that Ulta said the products were discontinued as they had heard nothing about it. After contacting the actual manufacturers, I found out that this was completely untrue.

Anyways, I'm not sure if my experiences are common for all Ulta's , or just this one, as I've only ever shopped here. The positives-- they have a lot of diversity between various lines and price points. If you want a black eye liner, you can spend $6 for a great one from Prestige, or $20 for a good one from Urban Decay. Same with hair care products, which I generally avoid because I'm terrible at doing my hair.

The negatives-- this store is really slow to receive new product. I've been checking for weeks to see when they will get new shades of L'Oreal Infallible e/s. I finally gave up and visited a few local drugstores (Rite-Aid, CVS, and Walgreens) until I found the new color in stock. Ulta, as of today, still doesn't have the new collection! Uhg. Also, they are slow to put out new collections. They had mailed out the free Clinique lipstick mailer *before* unboxing and setting up their new Clinique counter. What the heck? I had to wait a few weeks before returning and redeeming my free lipstick coupon.

Also, the sales people. Oh, the sales people....they are nice at best. Most of them are not informed and don't have much training. It's probably not their fault, but the store. I know Sephora has a lot more training for their employee's, so if I actually want to bother asking a sales person about something, I would go to Sephora or Nordstrom's, *not* Ulta.

The best part about Ulta's is their coupons. You can use a $3.50/off coupon (minimum purchase $10, drugstore items only, not prestige cosmetics) and a 20%-off one item coupon in the same transaction...mix that in with some of their buy one, get one 50% off deals and you just saved yourself a pretty penny.

Amazing selection, and it seemed everything I looked at was way cheaper than Target, etc. Lots of items on ""clearance"" at surprisingly low prices. Grabbed a few items, paid using one of the coupons I got in my Sunday newspaper, got home and looked in the bag, remembering the clerk had mentioned something about a ""free gift""....well, there was not ""a"" free gift - there were FIVE! - one of which was a KMS hair product (love KMS!), and one was a FULL SIZE Ulta eyeliner in the color I wear most - green. (Did she notice I have green eyes or was this simply a coincidence?) While the customer service is far lacking compared to Sephora, it was fun come home with a bag of goodies for ten bucks! 

That said, customer service needs some polishing. Never having visited an ULTA store, I wanted to peruse the ULTA brand cosmetics, but an employee re-stocking that display happened to have a bunch of boxes, etc right in front of it. I kind of felt in his way, and wish he had simply looked up, said hello or smiled. Moving on to another aisle, a woman did finally acknowledge my presence and ask if I needed assistance. (Turns out she was the one who later rang up my purchases, so perhaps they are short-staffed?) I asked her opinion on a particular shade of brow pencil I was considering - she agreed it was too dark for me. Then walked away.  At Sephora they take you to the display, show you better selections for your coloring, then offer to apply it so you can see before you buy. (I never did purchase one...)

I guess it just depends on what it is you are shopping for - sometimes you don't want a lot of attention -  just want to ""treasure hunt"", find bargains, or try new products without a huge investment - ULTA is just the place!",2012,LA,Luisiana,34.42947658,-119.87175968,Y,5

I visited Ulta in Orange County a few years ago, long before we got one in Santa Barbara. And no words capture the wonderfulness of this large, immaculate, shiny palace of beauty. 

I don't go much as it's out in Goleta by Costco and I have no reason to schlep out there. But PUR is the last tinted moisturizer I will wear for the rest of my life. If they go out of business, I will buy 20 tubes to hold me for a decade until a product comes to fill the void. 

It's 34 dollars and provides all the coverage I need at this point in my life. 

I bought a curling iron in the OC and it's terrific. And they have an enormous fragrance collection, from Escada to Burberry to Coach to Dior. The only fragrance they don't carry that I know of is Tom Ford. 

And the service is unequalled. The girls are so friendly and they know their stuff intimately. I bought for  64 dollars 1.7 ounces of Burberry Brit Sheer. It was only 12 dollars more than the 1 ounce: nearly double the quantity for just a little more! The woman also showed me an atomizer (refillable and washable) you can take on the plane for just 10 dollars. 

Unlike Sephora, which is rushed, cramped, and loud with often very irritating clubby music, Ulta is a joy to visit and they have all kinds of cutesy impulse buys at the counter. On your birthday month, you receive double points. And you don't have to mess with parking in Paseo Nuevo as you do for Sephora. It's not that the girls at Sephora aren't nice, but they are understaffed and at Ulta, you can really explore and ask questions. 

I cannot say enough for this store and do not understand the low Yelp rating at all. 

P.S. I bought a cute polka dot travel electric toothbrush for 15 last year. I lost it but I loved it and for 15, you can't do better.",2014,LA,Luisiana,34.42947658,-119.87175968,Y,1

But, I've definitely noticed a change at this ULTA, staff is very knowledgeable and helpful and especially the two handsome young makeup wearing men that work there (that I have seen), as well as the nice lady with the pretty eyeshadow at the brow bar. I came in for a foundation but they helped me find so much more and I feel more confident with my makeup practice. Also, they've improved so much with the visual quality of the store.

They have a lot of items. Basically any item to care for your hair (shampoo, conditioner, dry shampoo, oils, treatments, clips, scrunchies, bla bla bla), face (many cleansers, treatments, creams, masques, make up, mascara, etc etc) and body (nail polish, body wash, waxing items, TBC) .

Get the point? :) but why do I shop here? They have a pretty good return policy. If you purchase an item that ultimately fails, just take the item and the RECEIPT and get your $$$ back. Yep.

She only waited 20 minutes to wash the color out and when she was done she dried a little bit of it and noticed that the color did not take. SHOCKER! Then she tried to make excuses that the color of the salon is orange so my hair is just reflecting it. Wrong! She told me to wash it a few times and see if I like it. I didn't like it! So I made another appointment 3 weeks later and she sat me down and told me that she doesn't feel comfortable doing my hair because she's only been there for 2 months!!!! WTF! I wasted $80 on the first appointment and she completely wasted my time the second time. She told me to find a different person who can do it and she even recommended that I do the color stripping myself. There's no way I'm going to do that!!!

On average I would say I spend 10 - 15 min in line during which you can almost always find 2,3 if not 4 associates chatting in Clinique, MAC or even behind the counter. And if you're looking for advice or help with a specific product you're definitely out of luck. If you can even find a sales associate to ask for help 9/10 they'll hit you with "" I don't know"" and leave it at that. The sales associates clearly lack proper training and product knowledge and every time they've had to call a manager over the manager is so rude and condescending to the employee that it makes me regret I ever asked the initial employee for help. I guess you can't expect good service from staff who  get treated poorly from their managers.

I recommend browsing online or another local provider for their offerings rather than stopping in unless you know which specific product you want here!

The ""cheaper"" side of Ulta carries about 8-10 brands, but it's likely that a a fair number of those products are not well stocked. I tried to find a brow pencil in brown and wasn't tied to any brand, but it took looking through 5 separate brands to find a stocked selection. The same has happened for concealers, foundations, and lip colors -- you find the price point, style, and shade in a tester, then you realize the product you want isn't actually available to buy and take home.

Some of my frustrations with this store are related to the brands, not Ulta's, setup but it goes hand-in-hand. For example, it's awesome to see a beautiful display of $10 lipsticks, but then it's likely that none of them are sealed and there are no designated test products to open and look at the colors. Most sections don't have a single ""tester"", meaning *any* of the unsealed products could have been swatched... and it's not fun thinking about buying a product someone else has already tested.

When I'm at a beauty store like Ulta, I want to hear the wisdom of the make-up experts who work there and get their input. But at this location, I feel like you have to hunt them down and directly say ""I would like to spend $x on Y. What should I get?"" and the response and helpfulness has been widely varying, most often leaning toward seeming inconvenienced. This location always seems understaffed, weather you're looking for specific products or you're waiting in their longggg line to check out.

And thank goodness for salespeople like Christina who are there to guide us all through the many bits of glamour. This store has absolutely everything for pretty much every part of your body. And from head to toe there is something for everyone.

I actually went in with high hopes for finishing up my Christmas shopping, and got totally sidetracked with trying to find a signature scent for myself. Did I find one? No . . . but after pretty much spritzing every part of my body with several different manly sprays I think I may have it narrowed down to less than a dozen choices.

I was able to pretty much wrap up the rest of my Christmas shopping right here, and Christina helped me keep focus as we looked at my list, checked it twice, and ended up finding way more that I had anticipated. Who knew that beauty products can be so much fun to learn about. Christina totally opened up my eyes and mind to specialty beauty products that I never knew existed.

All I know is that I have never been so excited to have my family open the many gifts I purchased here. They too will also think that my inner-drag-queen had come out when selecting these items.

aWZRFmKByX9sLLU2isIzOA,n66mhHJpXftCUW9vXqeZwQ,1.0,"Since my last review, this place has gotten even worse. I went in last week in order to get something very specific that I found on their website. It specifically said the item was in stock at the Goleta store so I took a chance. 

So, not only was the item NOT in stock, the person I talked to said that it wasn't something she'd seen in MONTHS. So, wasted trip.

While I was there, I noticed there was an item that I usually use that had a great gift with purchase and it was worth it to me to get it.  The date of the gift with purchase was that day through about a week. This is important because it was literally the first day of the gift and it was about 20 minutes after the store opened. 

When I got to the register, I had to ask for the gift (it didn't automatically come up) and I was told they didn't have it. I asked them if they had a substitute and two salespeople looked through their stock to see if they could give me anything that would be comparable. I got nothing and still bought the item because I was embarrassed to say I didn't want it without the gift. Despite the fact that the gift was why I had decided to get it that day. 

In addition to the Case of the Missing Gifts (this has happened every time I've tried to redeem a coupon or advertised gift at this particular location) they had super messy shelves and empty shelves all over the store. I'm not sure if they're closing soon or if they just can't be bothered to clean up or restock. If they aren't closing, what does it say that they look like they are?

Also, ordering through the app prevents impulse shoppers (like me) from mindlessly shoveling a ton of products I don't need into my basket! 

For online orders, you have the option to skip the line, as well. There's a little desk right by the front door that's labeled ""Pick up."" In total, it takes about 1-2 minutes to get everything! You just need to show the order number (found in the confirmation email) and a driver's license. This genius set up reduces time spent in the store, and makes the transaction significantly more efficient. 

As for the customer service, I have only ever had positive experiences here. I've lived in Goleta for over a decade, and have been coming to this store religiously since it first opened (not a fan of Sephora). The people who work there are helpful and welcoming, but not over-the-top-breathing-down-your-neck friendly (thank goodness). In my opinion, there's nothing worse than people hovering!

I used to see Ulta's coupons in the Sunday paper and take stock of anything I needed.  Unfortunately, the coupons only apply to non-prestige brands, Ulta's included.  There are so many exclusions on those coupons that the ""deal"" itself might as well be null and void.  Totally a flaw in the company's policy if it is aiming to compete with the department stores in Oxford Valley, and more importantly: Sephora. 

With the exception of the person who used to wax my brows at the Benefit Brow Bar -- before she left -- became the only reason I would go here.  Otherwise, I've met happier people stocking shelves at the grocery store!  One night I walked in after I was at the gym and asked if the Urban Decay Naked eyeshadow palette was in stock.  Both employees just turned to each other as if we were in an episode of the Three Stooges.  Either they didn't know one of the store's major brands or they had never seen someone in sneakers and exercise clothes.  The girls hastily told me it wasn't in the store, yet there was a tester palette sitting in the aisle where Urban Decay was displayed.  Since it was going to take a Herculean effort to look in the computer or in the stock room, I just walked out and gave my business to Sephora.

A month or two later, I revisited in the afternoon, and went for my brow waxing.  This my brow girl's last day and I couldn't say I blamed her.  I paid immediately after the service since her shift was over, then I went looking for an eyeliner.  I scanned the aisles for the product and someone who could help me since the cashier said she could not leave the register.  No problem.  I noticed an employee in the back where the salon is located, though I needed to use a bathroom, so I asked the cashier if there was one.  She called over the person I had seen near the salon who had the key, then let me in.  After I was finished, I told the person I was out, and she was actually very friendly.  When I asked her about the product I was looking for, she told me she could not leave the salon.  Again, I understand, so I took another once-over down the aisle.  

With no luck, I headed for the door, and that's when I was confronted by an employee.  ""Excuse me, I saw you wandering around and I'm going to need you to open your bag.""  She had this shit-eating grin on her face like she was going to get Employee of the Year for busting a shoplifter.  It was alarming, yet I kept my cool and replied, ""Melissa waxed my brows, the cashier let me into the bathroom, here is the recei-...""  

""OPEN YOUR BAG.""

Now this woman is in my face, basically trying to bully me into her own version of search and seizure.  You got a warrant to go with that name tag, too?  So, extremely offended, I opened my bag and showed her the receipt, as well as moving aside my wallet and other personal items to prove her theory wrong.  I guess some mental breakthrough occurred because all of a sudden, she softens with, ""Oh, I saw you wandering around...""  to which I cut her off with, ""Yes, because no one is on the floor to help any customers, then I asked the cashier to use the bathroom, which she and your coworker in the salon can confirm.""

I didn't stick around to hear Ms. Justice's reply because you know what?  Just because a customer is young, DOES NOT mean he/she is going to steal.  Since then, I've taken my business to Flirt Beauty in Yardley and Bensalem, and other *worthy* local shops.

A few months ago I stopped in to try a new hairstylist and I was introduced to Mary Jane. I am extremely picky!!!!...and had a lot of requests.  I have wildly curly frizzy long hair that I straighten every day. 

However I have never seen my hair look so beautiful and so straight, as when Mary Jane did it for me...it even lasted until the next day and it was raining the night we did it!  

I loved what she did with my hair so much that when my mom was visiting on vacation I made an appointment for the two of us. We both had color and I had highlights and we left looking like movie stars. My mom felt 15 years younger and if I do say so, I thought she looked 20 years younger myself.  My father even complimented her! (which is both rare and amazing). 

Mary Jane talks to you about what your specific requirements are and makes you feel comfortable with your selection. We listened to her suggestions and were so happy we did. 

This girl is so good she should open her own salon!!!

I showed up for my appt on time and had to wait around for 20 minutes for the girl to come start my appt. This was after I walked to the front of the store to ask if someone else could do my nails because I was tired if waiting and I had to be somewhere an hour and a half later. They had a decent collection of OPI gel colors which was nice but that is the only reason I gave them 2 stars. Once my manicure started I could tell the girl doesn't do them very often because the gel is never supposed to touch your skin or cuticle or it won't seal properly. After my nails were done she didn't use any lotion or cuticle oil so my hands were dry and gross when I left.

Spa is such a bad word for the two, dimly lit, plain, and somewhat dirty rooms in the back of the store. It did not feel like a spa-they waxed my brows at a freaking hair washing sink with a plastic tub full of supplies they pulled out of a cabinet. Nothing was set up for waxing, it felt like I was getting a wax out of the trunk of a car. On top of that, hey charged two dollars more then the Benefit bar. The girl, Rebecca, was sweet. However, I told her exactly what I wanted and I mentioned multiple times that I thought she was taking too much off and what did she do? Take too much off. Not happy with the outcome at all.

Note that my other review was 5 stars because it was just about the brow bar. I'd probably give the rest of the store 3 stars because the staff, not including specialty staff (Benefit, Dermalogica, etc.), are very rude and make it very aware how much they hate their jobs. Anyway, here's the review for the brow bar:

Michelle is a GODSEND! I went into Ulta looking like Frida Kahlo and *thankfully* Michelle had an open spot to fill before her next client. I explained how I just couldn't find someone who could get the right shape for my brow (or any shape really) and that I wanted a natural look as opposed to being permanently surprised. She laughed and assured me that she would fix everything up. That was an understatement. My brows are now absolute perfection. I can't stop staring at them. After she tweezed (wax irritates my skin) and trimmed them, she filled them in with the Benefit products, not once pushing me to buy anything. The best part of the whole experience was the great conversation we had while she was reconstructing my face. Michelle was so nice and hilarious and I could have sat there all day chatting. 

I'm so glad that I took a chance and switched up my brow routine! Michelle is definitely my new go-to-girl now that I have fabulous brows that need maintaining.",2014,ID,Idaho,40.1851779,-74.8651605472,Y,12

As far as color, Erin did a decent job blending it all in. But as far as my cut.... I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Mid way through my appointment I smelled alcohol on her breath and when she arrived late to my appointment she had a blue slushy and it all kinda made sense. I wish I would've said something when I smelled it but because I was just trying to fix my hair and get out I let her keep going. (I was there for 3 and a half hours) We both had agreed to only cut off what was necessary. Keep in mind my original stylist back home was working with me to grow out my layers and let everything grow out evenly. When Erin showed me the back of my hair I almost cried. She butchered the back putting in short layers on my what I would consider to be long hair. It was so choppy that she went back in with her texturizing shears and TOOK MORE OFF. And then proceeded to say, ""I don't usually criticize other stylists work but omg who took your layers up that high?"" Meanwhile like I said my previous stylist was working with me to grow them out so I haven't had them touched in over 6 months. Now I have two completely different lengths of hair.

I've went through hell and back with my hair in 2017, and I was feeling really good about being at this salon in general. The vibes felt great, the salon didn't make me feel off or uncomfortable. The good vibes were there! 

My best friend knows how scared I am of hair stylists because of how much I went through in the last year. So I had a really tough semester, and wanted to make myself feel good about myself again. I fell into this rut, and I was exhausted, sad, and overall over 2017. 

There were two photos that I showed my stylist, Heather, as to what I wanted. She consulted me about the color choice beforehand. Let me know what happens to fashion color etc. I've been into fashion color for some time now, and have been dying to go pink!  

I wanted my roots to be left alone because I was pre-lightened, and I just wanted some fun color done. Heather has such a great personality! I hope she never leaves, because I'm definitely becoming a regular. Fairless Hills is quite a hike from me. I'm near Northern Liberties in Philadelphia, PA, but I'll drive anywhere for quality service! I have an appointment with her again, March 9th, and I'm ecstatic that I chose someone I already trust to do what's next. 

She really seems like she knows what she's doing; I'm so glad she made me pink, and the pink came out amazingly! It lasted over 2 months, and she also recommended me some awesome dry shampoos. With her consulting, I made my pink last a long time! I was obsessed, and still obsessed; everyone was obsessed. I felt so magical and fun! I work in a conservative environment, but they were over the moon with it! They loved it and were accepting of it considering my reasons for getting it.

Things to Consider:
Like one of the reviews stated this is more of a self service location. If you know your beauty products and makeup you will do okay and Ulta and able to get in and out. If you need more help in cheaper brands, beauty products and etc then you may find it hard to get a little help. On the other hand in the makeup department for the non Ulta brands you will find the best chances for help at this location. 

I love this location because there is a salon and a Benefit Brow Bar, which are important in my world and probably get all of my money. They bought offer pretty reasonably priced services and most important quick. The turnaround on services here is great especially when they stick to appointments. If you are looking to get your hair down ask for GiGi she is the queen of the blowout and style. For Eyebrows definitely let Maria do them.

Another great thing about this location is brands brands brands. They tend to stay stocked with my favorites along with others such as a pretty massive Smashbox section as well as Benefit section. You will also see other brands such as Urban Decay and Still among many others in the makeup department. There is a reasonable sized skin scare section. I often don't see much help in this area so it can be frustrating trying to figure it out.  Another good thing about this location is there is lotttttttttttttttts of hair products. Whatever your needs are they probably have it to get your hair together.

I'm just happy they have this location in the city. The staff is friendly and definitely efficient and I have not had any problems at all.

I explained that I didn't want anything too dramatic and liked the smokey eye look. She seemed to understand my goal and proceeded to ask me what colors I was wearing. She chose complimentary hues and away she went. The make-up application happens in the middle of the store where they can easily pull from the shelves.

I like Ulta in general because they have a nice mix of high end and drugstore beauty products....it's kind of a one-stop-shop of make-up/beauty.  

I threw the new cashier off because I had two coupons* at check out.  That's OK, she's new, the store is new, and I was patient.  She had to call a manager over and, here is where the bad taste was put in my mouth, the manager not only barked rudely at the cashier, she literally berated every worker around her.  Is this the way to start out a new store?  You could already tell every underling was completely alienated from said manager.  2nd day? Really?

They had a nice selection of, well, everything. BUT, I could not get over the shabby treatment of the employees who were more than nice to me.  I can only believe the employee turnover will be high.

My imagined truth is that this mean manager is a high-level executive from corporate and she is here temporarily to open the store.  Hopefully the real manager is from New Orleans, awesome, and I will return in 3 weeks and witness the happiest employees ever.   I'll let you know...

I like to browse around on my own, so I don't need a tour of the place and if I'm stopping in to pick up product that's running low, I'm all about the grab and go.  However, on this particular visit, I wanted to get some insight on concealer.

I must have wandered around for 20 minutes and not one of them looked at me as they pondered the difficulty of setting regular hours in retail.  Granted, no one there is a dermatologist, so it's no like I missed out on anything, but isn't the point of being a specialized store the fact that you offer in-depth, personal service to clients.  Aren't the associates trained to be (or appear to be) subject matter experts?

IIFsTrVUBjgjujSHIRyTiA,gNs9um_3hB3L8HFyMk2x4w,4.0,"I've been here three times. Fortunately for my pocketbook and schedule, I'm not a makeup fanatic, because this store has so much stuff. I know some people probably go broke in here. I'm going to try to stay away because I could easily get hooked.

While there yesterday and the day before, I saw so many different brands from so many different celebrities and people I learned about through YouTube right alongside the brands that have been around for years. There is something for everyone. 

Upon entering the store, there were several people mulling around the front door. I couldn't figure out what exactly was going on. I'm guessing the store was having a party, team meeting, or maybe they just happened to be there at the time I entered. I'm not sure if one of those many people greeted me or if they were even employees. But as I made my way further into the store, an associate asked whether or not I needed anything. I declined and continued on the search for the specific product I had come for. 

The shelf had a spot and price tag for the product I'd come for but there was nothing there. There were similar products by the same manufacturer next to the empty spot so I decided to look for someone to assist me. This turned out to be a small challenge. I couldn't find anyone in that area of the store. I walked around the general area trying to figure out who worked there and who didn't. Finally, two ladies appeared about the same time at a counter in the rear of the store. I asked if perhaps the product might be in the back and one of them went to check. She returned with the last one in the store which was wonderful. I returned to the front to check out.  The line area has lots of last minute temptations, but once again, I was thankful that none of it interested me.  There were two or three people checking customers out and one or two more doing different things in the register area. I've concluded that getting customers out the door is not a number one priority here.

Although the store is well organized, sections are clearly designated, and lighting is perfect, if employees had a uniform look, a smock, or if this huge store had little stations where customers could summons assistance, it would be helpful for those of us who are not experts in ""beauty"". 

I ended up needing to return the item I purchased because I was not satisfied with it. I looked online for Ulta's return policy and was delighted to find out that I would have no trouble getting a refund even though he item had been opened and used, and could not be resold. They have a very fair and accommodating return policy.

The store has more than just make up. It has curling irons, blow dryers, waxing kits, lighted mirrors, facial equipment, the list goes on and on. After returning home, I received an email survey about my experience. Through the survey, I learned that they offer services. I had no idea. But yeah, they offer hair and skin services and even make up. 

I will say it one more time:  I'm so glad I'm not into make up because this store has way too much stuff and it looks like it could be fun.",2019,TN,Tennessee,29.9611092426,-90.1856499528,Y,12
ELfP3v7fG_C1xiB0bEaJuA,gNs9um_3hB3L8HFyMk2x4w,2.0,"I am the biggest makeup junkie (ask any of my friends)-I have gone days without buying food yet somehow managed to still purchase new makeup. 

Given my love for makeup, I've always loved Ulta because they have such a wide variety of not just high end products but drugstore products as well. I also like the layout better than Sephora (not as cluttered, brighter, more spacious). With that said, I'm not a fan of this location. The products are great, the store is clean, but each time I've been here the employees haven't been helpful at all. They can typically be found in a corner gossiping and when I've asked them for help (e.g. Where are your dry shampoos? Where are your self tanners?), they come across bothered. And I'm not someone that necessarily expects a salesperson to come
up to me asking if I need help, but when I do ask for help, at the very least I expect help in return without an attitude.

It's a shame because if the employees were friendlier this review would be five stars instead of two stars, but every time I go to this location I leave with a bad taste in my mouth.

Despite all of this, I'll still go every so often as I do love Ulta, but now I'll only go to this location if I can't find the products at a CVS or Sephora.",2017,TN,Tennessee,29.9611092426,-90.1856499528,Y,11

ELfP3v7fG_C1xiB0bEaJuA,gNs9um_3hB3L8HFyMk2x4w,2.0,"Okay I normally don't do this but now I'm frustrated.

Long story short, I know makeup. I've done makeup for weddings, proms, models, etc. My specialty is skin/complexion, so I KNOW the difference between warm/cool/neutral foundations. With that said, I went in today because I had a coupon and wanted to get some more foundations.

Again, I know my undertones. So I began talking to the NARS rep and decided to purchase the sheer glow foundation-one of my favorites. I told him I wanted one shade just slightly darker than my skin because I get spray tans but that I still wanted it to be in the warm/golden family-I then pointed at the shade Punjab because I've owned it before and know it's my perfect shade. He then questioned me and said ""um you mean something with a rosy/cool undertone then? Because Punjab is rosy and a warmer shade will be too yellow for you."" This was after I told him I do makeup, so it came across a bit demeaning-as if I don't really know what I'm talking about. I kind of just nodded my head and said ""sure"" because I didn't want to come across mean, but I was confused. He then put Punjab on me and just like I said, it matched me perfectly. I ended up purchasing Punjab and their concealer in the shade cannelle. He kept referring to them as ""rosy""

When I got home, I immediately googled the two shades on NARS site to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and they are described as ""golden"" and ""peachy"" (see attached photos).

So why am I writing this? 1. Because although the NARS rep was nice, I didn't like his comments 2. If you're going to have a NARS rep at your store, he/she should at least be able to properly tell the difference between undertones and not improperly refer to shades as being something they are not.

All in all, my experiences at this location have been way too hit or miss for me to definitively give them more than 2 stars. Sorry Ulta, but until you get your act together I'm officially done visiting your Elmwood location.",2018,TN,Tennessee,29.9611092426,-90.1856499528,Y,4

We was asked if we needed help by the fragrance counter. We was just testing different perfume/cologne just to see which one we wanted for the summer weather. We picked two and put in our bag. I had a few more items I had to get since I'm a Professional makeup artist. We was followed constantly by the police and associates!  Meanwhile, I go to an aisle to find concealers, and see there were two girls with large bags talking about what they was going to steal! I was like what the heck! So I left and went to the Mac area. I was looking for the Mac Mineralize powder that I use for my clients. The darkest color they had was Deep!  I was like what the hell! The girl said I know everybody ask for Dark Deep. My fiancé said well it looks like you guys need to get darker shades since it's popular. Then he said well I see y'all want a certain race here huh?  She turned red. Lol. That's a shame. We walked away. And got in line to check out. We spent about $250 in this store. And honestly my fiancé was like no, don't buy here since they are like discriminating and acting like we can't buy here. I said no. I just KNOW I WONT BE BACK AND WILL TELL PPL NOT TO GO THERE.

I knew I wasn't going to drop money on anything expensive, and I talked myself into coming here.

jSdmlVFO_mCDDgjAA2fjGw,HLwzUJ8IZwP2mLpMMF5x7g,4.0,"This Ulta is in GulfView Mall and not as large as the store off Gulf To Bay but still has a decent selection, except for their perfumes.. The shelves are always practically empty. I visit this location at least once a month and for the most part, the employees don't talk to you even if you are just blank staring at a wall, like a lost baby. They won't budge to ask if you need help, whatever. If I want it, I'll go look for you. 
Howeevvveerrr, there is a man who works in the salon area who is very helpful and knowledgeable! I wish I knew his name.. He has facial piercings, that is all I can remember. Anyways, I walked up to the wall o' hair care looking for purple shampoo. I will be the first to admit I know nothing about my hair. I had the Redken brand on my hand when he approached and asked if I needed help. ""Yeeeesssss thank you!!!"" 
He showed me three of the top brands and explained the different pros and cons of each. He definitely made me feel very confident that I made the right purchase. 
Later on, a different employee came up to me and complimented me on my shoes (why thank you) and just all around it was an awesome shopping experience. 
Not to say every time is this enjoyable and heart warming though.. This past weekend I was looking for a specific eyeshadow palette from Too Faced. I couldn't find a spot that even said Peanut Butter so I asked an employee if the Too Faced palettes were any where else in the store, to which she quickly snapped at me, ""No. We are all sold out of peanut butter."" Okay. ""And if you next question is about Peaches, we don't have that either."" I wanted to just leave right then and there.. But I also wanted my Dark Chocolate palette.. Night staff is a delight!

The woman didn't acknowledge me kept scanning finally I said ""so you probably don't care why I'm returning. Nothing.

other people helped with my skin care selection. My 4th visit was another cut plus I brought my husband for a cut also. An employee came over while waiting to see if I needed help.

I will say that the service can be spotty. Like today. When I walked in 2 ladies, one of them was the General Manager were holding a conversation that was far too busy to give up in lieu of customers coming into the store.  After about 5 minutes they walked over to see if they could be any help. 

It's service like this that makes stores like Ulta and sephora seem unapproachable, but if you know what you're looking for, you'll find it.  What I was truly happy about was that I found that Urban Decay lipsticks were 50% off due to them being discontinued for re-boxing. New packaging means a great bargain.

This way I could try what I wanted, be helped by someone who was familiar with the products, and purchase them right there. I was quite excited the first time I attempted to go, and left feeling not so great. There were three employees working, and two were talking, and one was stocking or going over products at the counter. I couldn't get a person, and after a while, I left. My second visit I had a similar experience, except I did get a person to talk to me after I followed her around, and felt I annoyed her by asking a question. I was looking for a pretty specific product, and if You've been to Ulta before, you know that sending someone down an isle to look is not much help. When I looked like I couldn't find it, she came over and pointed to everything around there, and said ""these are all in the same catagory"", not what I wanted whatsover. Again, she was stocking, and didn't want to help I would have liked to try something, but she was pretty rude, and I wouldn't have wanted her help even had she offered it (which she didn't). My third time there (yes, possibly stupidity), I happen to pass it (it's in a mall), and saw three woman at the counter, and crossed my fingers and toes. I walked in and spent my usual ten minutes there, not knowing where anything was, and wondering if they really do show people how to use their makeup, because I had never seen it. Im not sure if it's just that location, but as one who tends to spend money on makeup, I was pretty astounded, and wondered if they ever had a manager around. Had I been one around, there would be three people looking for a job, or much better trained. At the least acknowledge a person is in your store, especially considering you have to walk right past the desk when you enter the store. Personally, I would rather buy makeup from Walgreens, until I am in Tampa and can go where they seem to care about selling a product, or making a commission, or maybe they just enjoy their jobs, but in any event, three times is one time more than I usually give, and It won't happen again!!!  BY the way, just for the record, when I was there all three times, the store was empty.

I've never gone in and there not been a line wrapping into the store from the registers. And it's not like they are under staffed... It's because several employees are not at the register. There was one specific time when they manager or shift leading employee was called (through the headsets) from the one girl left to tend to the registers alone 3x for help. She finally came to assist, and then decided to carry on a personal conversation (she was friends with the guest she rang up) for 5 minutes when there was still 3 more people in line. Leaving the other girl to the line again while she just talked... I finally made it to the register, and she picked up a call (which had been ringing for quite sometime) rather than help me.

Unbelievable... I try to continue shopping here and she still acts like this when I give multiple other chances.

I did use their beauty services and we're pleased. That's where the 2 stars come from. If you book online it is easy to get an appointment that fits your schedule.

Ux0CsHDQvEbtZXlGDgcCHg,G4gzTUGV2xAoz6CG9STqfg,1.0,"8/7/2020 - I'm actually surprised I haven't heard from Ulta since my review. 

Sadly, since I initially posted my review, I've been dealing with severe breakage (pieces that are 2 - 3"" long, even after being forced to cut almost 3"" off!). 

I get angry every time I look in the mirror - my hair is hideous looking, and will be for months!!!

And I resent that the salon manager said they'll use this experience as a ""learning opportunity"" for the stylist who ruined my hair...really? That girl needs to go back to school (her name is Kimberly, by the way...do not book with her unless it's a simple cut or blow out). 

*********************

Warning - do NOT go to the hair salon there!

I went to have some of my roots touched up (I was blonde up until this incident, about 2 weeks ago), get a color gloss, and a cut. I had been doing my own hair for months, and it was in good shape and condition before I walked into the salon. 

I was assigned a stylist (who I found out during my service that she had very little experience and wasn't yet 21...which is why she didn't take what I was telling her about my hair seriously). 

She bleached the roots, but the bleach didn't take. I mentioned that the product wasn't doing what it was supposed to, but she said it was a self-timed product and would stop processing automatically (FYI - the bleaching process didn't lighten my roots at all - but she left it on long enough to fry my hair, pretty severely). 

She rinsed out the product and went to prep the gloss shade (I had asked for something more platinum vs yellow. I also know a gloss needs to stay in the hair for at least 15 minutes.). Less than 30 seconds after she applied it, she was finding it out. I jokingly said ""the color must be taking"" and she said ""yeah"". Then I asked, ""shouldn't this be on my hair longer?"". Her response was that since she saw the color depositing, she could rinse it out.

She then took me back to the chair and said she was going to trim my hair and even out the layers. I specifically asked her not to take off any of the length or cut my bangs. She barely cut any of my hair, but what she did cut ended up looking like a mullet! And because if her poor bleaching technique my hair has such extreme breakage - I'm losing so much hair every day (and I'm getting depressed looking in the mirror everyday to see how badly she destroyed my hair). 

I went back to my darker color a few days after my appointment because it will prevent me from having to color it as frequently vs when I was blonde. 

I did call the salon the day after and spoke with the salon manager. I let her know about all the issues, and how bad my hair was (the stylist took so much off from the top of my scalp area that it sticks straight up! Now I realize she was trying to hide the fact that my hair was breaking off so much from her poor technique.

I'm giving 2 stars because they did, without incident, give me a full refund for the service.

I went to have some of my roots touched up (I was blonde up until this incident, about 2 weeks ago), get a color gloss, and a cut. I had been doing my own hair for months, and it was in good shape and condition before I walked into the salon. 

I was assigned a stylist (who I found out during my service that she had very little experience and wasn't yet 21...which is why she didn't take what I was telling her about my hair seriously). 

She bleached the roots, but the bleach didn't take. I mentioned that the product wasn't doing what it was supposed to, but she said it was a self-timed product and would stop processing automatically (FYI - the bleaching process didn't lighten my roots at all - but she left it on long enough to fry my hair, pretty severely). 

She rinsed out the product and went to prep the gloss shade (I had asked for something more platinum vs yellow. I also know a gloss needs to stay in the hair for at least 15 minutes.). Less than 30 seconds after she applied it, she was finding it out. I jokingly said ""the color must be taking"" and she said ""yeah"". Then I asked, ""shouldn't this be on my hair longer?"". Her response was that since she saw the color depositing, she could rinse it out.

She then took me back to the chair and said she was going to trim my hair and even out the layers. I specifically asked her not to take off any of the length or cut my bangs. She barely cut any of my hair, but what she did cut ended up looking like a mullet! And because if her poor bleaching technique my hair has such extreme breakage - I'm losing so much hair every day (and I'm getting depressed looking in the mirror everyday to see how badly she destroyed my hair). 

I went back to my darker color a few days after my appointment because it will prevent me from having to color it as frequently vs when I was blonde. 

I did call the salon the day after and spoke with the salon manager. I let her know about all the issues, and how bad my hair was (the stylist took so much off from the top of my scalp area that it sticks straight up! Now I realize she was trying to hide the fact that my hair was breaking off so much from her poor technique.

I'm giving 2 stars because they did, without incident, give me a full refund for the service. 

But I'm utterly disgusted that now I'm spending just as much on deep conditioning treatments to minimize the amount of breakage.

I LOVE this ULTA!  Its one of the largest stores Ive been to and has a lot of products that the smaller ones may not have.  This ULTA is also at Coolsprings Mall so its super convenient to just pop in while I'm at the mall for other stuff.  Ill be honest, its never really a ""pop in"", its usually what I like to call a meandering.  My husband knows that if I'm going into ULTA its going to be a long wait or he should have something to do while I meander.  If youre a lover of all things makeup and hair like myself you get what I'm trying to say! For all those men out there DONT FEEL LEFT OUT!! They have an entire section of mens products from Shampoo to Cologne! So if you need to smell nice for your significant other then you can pop in and one of the great ULTA associates will help you find exactly what you need! OR if you need a great stocking stuffer....and ULTA gift card is NEVER a bad thing!! (ur welcome ladies!)

ULTA has everything, bodywash, shampoos, styling tools, perfume, makeup(over the counter and higher end), and so so SO much more...this is why its a meander and not a pop in. lol. The staff at this ULTA are amazing and always willing to help when needed but also happy to leave you to your own devices which is nice in my opinion.  Sometimes I like to try something new and being left to do that without a sales pitch makes it that much easier to do that, but I know that if I have a product question they are there and ready.  They also carry higher end makeup selections and usually have an expert for that brand in store so color matching and asking specific questions is a breeze! 

Overall I will always choose ULTA for my products because the return policy is amazing.  If you purchase a product and don't like it, its not the right color, its doesn't work well for you, or u have a reaction to it, return it! Even if you have used the product a couple times you can return it, that's nice when you have sensitive skin and things don't always work for you.

So pop in and meander around, get your brows done and find a new product you didn't even know you needed!! They have millions of them to choose from! Im sure ill see you there lol.",2019,IN,Indiana,35.95469913,-86.81443691,Y,11

My mother and I were in the area and went in so I can introduce her to the make up products I've been using from Ulta, needless to say we came to spend money. The staff was condescending, quick to dismiss us and overall felt as if we were going into the usually ego-filled Mac store, which is one of the reasons I stopped using Mac.

Makeup smeared on the displays, products opened, used, laying on the ground or sitting open in displays, products not stocked, completely empty displays, damaged products on shelves for weeks and weeks. I saw the same dented, used can of ""Pssst"" for wavy hair dry shampoo sitting on the same shelf for well over a month. Every time I would come in, it would be the only can there, sitting, waiting for the forever home that would never come. 

I stopped in yesterday to redeem some points and check out the display of Ulta brand makeup and my God, it was foul. Smashed blushes all over, eye shadow quads with the safety seals torn open, smudged all over, open lipsticks, just gross. I walked down to the NYX aisle only to see some angsty teenager sitting on the ground pulling lipsticks out, breaking the seal, trying them on and then tossing them on the ground. I had to leave. It was just too gross. I love Ulta as a whole, but I refuse to buy products from this location for fear that they have been used (which has happened before, sadly).

The girl was really nice which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. I get eyelash extensions all the time and had to go here for a last minute emergency but now I'm in an even bigger emergency... eyelash-less. She went really fast which made me a little skeptical from the start. I don't know where she learned or where that went wrong but she glued them to my actual lashes... biggest mistake. Anyone who has even so much as had this procedure done before knows that you glue to the skin in between the lashes to avoid lash-loss. Anyway, within a day or 2 the extensions were so tangled, upside down, twisted, and just plain old ridiculous looking, but bearable. But then after about a week they started to clump together so bad and formed this ball of glue/ gunk at the root of my real lashes to the point of pain with every blink. I tried every at home remedy to get them off safely but without fail it would take my lashes with them. So I stopped trying and am now waiting for them to come off naturally... if that will even happen. In the meantime I guess I'll just look like a scarecrow and try not to blink so much :)

With my skin looking really blah after this long winter, I desperately needed new foundation and products to help me. When my skin really needs a glow, I go for tinted moisturizer, specifically Laura Mercier or Stila. Unfortunately, this Ulta does not carry either product, bummer! I did not see any Laura Mercier products although they had a big wall of Stila products.

An employee helped me to find a different BB cream, from Smashbox. He did not really do a great job talking it up or exploring my options, and I felt like he was just going through the motions and did not really give a crap. I remembered that the Hello Flawless Oxygen Foundation by Benefit received good reviews, so a different employee helped me pick out one of those in my shade. She seemed a little nicer and more caring, but still not a very personalized experience.

I also picked up a Mario Badescu product, make up sponges, and some Burts Bees chapstick. 

I had a 20% off coupon on one item, but unfortunately that did not apply to ""prestige"" brands, of which Benefit and Mario Badescu were a part of. Well, how was I supposed to know that?? It took a whopping $1.00 off of my chapstick, whoop-de-do.",2016,NV,Nevada,39.92628326,-75.03470717,Y,2

I have never had an issue and love the lash tech but always wondered how much and how often they practiced hygiene and sanitation because the girl never wore gloves, I never saw her wash her hands, clean tools etc. I trusted them Until my last appointment right before xmas/December 2019. The lash tech had been out/not at work for a few months and when she came back it wasnt the same. My lashes/eyelids were itching and hurting for a few days. After about a week I removed the lashes because I couldn't take it-- lash tech said it was the new glue. I went back about 2 weeks later in early January 2020 to get them redone. This time they looked better and felt better except the very next morning I woke up with PINK EYE. I contacted the lash tech/sent her pictures and advised her so no one else would have the experience. She said she would talk to her manager & offered to redo them .... but why would I want to risk another eye infection. I never heard anything back from her or the manager. I contacted ULTA 2 weeks after speaking with the Tech & the manager said she had not heard of the incident. I asked for a refund and at first it was if she didn't believe me... i said look I have proof--Urgent care diagnosis, pictures of my eyes, and screenshots of the conversation between me and the lash tech. I got my lashes done late afternoon Sunday and woke up for work Monday morning at 7am and could barely open my eye. The manager was nice about it though, she contacted her Manager and they said they would give me refund.

I had a random day off of work because of the rain and booked easily online for 45 min later so I could get in and out.  I got there and the store was empty (the rain was horrible).  I was escorted to the back where they have a full service salon (I didn't even know it was there!).  Cristial was my hairdresser and she's amazing!! She is so personable and listens to what you want. In October I had gone to a different salon to get a long bob bit it wasn't quite a bob like I had wanted so I explained I did want it shorter.  She did a beautiful job and even styled it perfectly (but again the rain messed that up).  I booked a trim in 6 weeks with Cristial because I do not want to take a chance somewhere else!  I found my new hair dresser and it's a hidden gem!!,2016,IN,Indiana,29.921897,-90.039236,Y,3

FhY1IXX3phu_PS_qVpSY9w,FiIIuZGT-VJEju-bwNQTuA,1.0,"One time about 20 years ago I was going to Jamaica with my best friend Kayla and I stopped at a little nail salon and had my brows done. That woman gave me two totally unfamiliar eyebrows, one being a straight line and the otherbeing shaped like an upside down U. There comes a point (especially) particularly ABSOLUTELY with regards to eyebrows that if somebody effs up your eyebrows once you do not give them a second chance. DO NOT LET them fix it I repeat DO NOT LET THEM NEAR YOUR BROWS. They can't fix it they messed up to begin with. That's when you either have to resort to doing it yourself or going to somebody else to have them fix it. Such was the case with this trip to Ulta.  First it took her 20 minutes to do it and I swear had had it not been for the pain and ripping sound I would not have known that she did anything to my eyebrows at all. She literally scrubbed them with her dry cotton pad for probably half the time and in the end they looked oily but there was no shape. none whatsoever. It was ironic because she was telling me as she was doing my eyebrows that a woman had messed up her eyebrows, so I'm not sure if this was some sort of revenge thing like The Ring where the only way to get rid of the bad brows is to give somebody else bad brows.  I don't know. And the cost? Ridiculous! $21 for a mediocre brow wax when there are literally three kiosks within 50 feet of that store that do twice as good a job for half the amount of money and half the amount of time. She gave me her business card (which I left at the register) but quite frankly if I can't trust her with my brows I damn sure ain't going to trust her with my hair.  I guess I should mention that this review was not of the Ulta store itself which while usually understaffed is still a quiet, unintrusive shopping experience and they almost always have when I'm looking for. pardon any typos this review was written via voice to text while driving furiously away from the appointment like Cruella Deville at the end of 101 Dalmationsduring the car chase scene. i'm telling you guys I just don't know I don't know what went wrong.

boYagKUBWhjoDfZ7z8xhwA,9EZ6JKyqirjyE0GGHERmUQ,5.0,"Love this Ulta. but it's the salon that really made me a lifelong customer. I've been shopping at Ulta since I was a teen and have lived in 6 different states, but no Ulta has shown more integrity to me than this location. Long story short,  had a less than favorable trip to the Ulta salon a few weeks ago, but it wasn't because of the stylist, it was because of their pricing and (lack of) communication between myself and the salon as I went in for my appointment. The salon and my stylist stepped up and welcomed me back to remedy the situation. I was nervous because I was afraid I would be treated badly because of being a customer who ""complained"". 

My nerves were unwarranted. The salon manager Carry welcomed me in and listened to everything I had to say about my previous visit, and my stylist Sara and her both chatted with me about the miscommunication in my first visit and what could be done to fix it. I was blown away by their integrity and compassion towards me. And to top it off my hair was even better than I had hoped when I left. 

I am someone who likes to give my money to businesses that practice things I believe in like transparency and compassion, even when that business is a little more pricey than the next. The kindness, professionalism, and compassion shown towards me was the icing on the cake for me and my hair, which turned out better than I had wanted. I've already made my return appointment to Sarah and look forward to many more future visits after. I've been getting my hair professionally done since I was 13 years old, and it became a special part of my relationship with my mom and sister, and I will be recommending them to Ulta Salon. Thank you Ulta and the Salon staff of Ulta Greenwood, Indiana. I am proud to continue to shop and get my hair done from a company with such incredible customer service and integrity within its staff.

hQ1Agg-WwkH81FX-rUB7QA,9EZ6JKyqirjyE0GGHERmUQ,3.0,"Overall experience was fairly good but there were a few things that bothered me.

1. I just got my septum pierced literally just a few days ago so it's still super sore. I went in looking for foundation initially and (obviously) got a few extras but anyway the lady that was helping me and did the foundation for me to see how it looked was super rough on me! Like I told her to please be gentle because my piercing was just done and she didn't even care and hit it a few time which really hurt. After I left I was actually bleeding from my nose where my piercing is because of it. 

2. I was JUST looking for foundation but the lady helping me threw 10 different products at me. Like I get that you're a salesperson but if I come in just looking for foundation why are you trying to get me to buy 2 primers, foundation, highlighter kit, contour kit, setting spray, exfoliator AND eye cream? It honestly made me feel stupid but I KNOW makeup and I just wanted to find a light weight foundation that matched my super pale skin tone  

3. It took ten minutes to get someone to help me by literally having stand in the same spot and stare at them until someone decided to help me. I saw multiple different employees but they ignored everyone around them including myself. 

4. I did find the foundation I needed/was looking for. So that's good. And the lady overall that helped me did get me what I was looking for which is good but I feel like it was a lot more work (and nose trauma) than necessary. 

The only saving grace was their tiny section of clearance where I got a bundle kit for 14  but I think the customer service here needs a lot of work. Overall it's a decent store. I just moved here so I'm new to the area and this was my first time going here. I will probably look at a few different places to see which store is best.

I said fine can I do purple, not a bright shade but definitely purple. She said sure. She slathered my hair in dye, 2 bottles worth... extra charge of course. When she was rinsing it out she kept going back and forth from the room and at one point came back and put something that smelled like acetone on my hair. After letting that sit and rinsing it out I went back to the chair for my cut, I asked for an aline bob. She took all of probably (generous estimate) 10 minutes giving me a blunt cut. She dried my hair and to my joy (sarcasm) my hair was red with a slight purple tint. She asked if I wanted layers around my face, she just held the hair framing my face and ran the scissors down both sides. I could've done that, I have done that. After applying a discount for my first hair appointment  I paid $122.25 for a crappy hair dye and cut. So disappointed but I waved it off as a loss and moved on.

The store is a fairly large size, so it can be overwhelming to navigate.  

I wandered around for a while looking for a few items. A few of the things I needed I found right away, but I was struggling to find a few other products. Even though the store was basically empty, it was hard to find a store rep.  When I did find somebody to ask them a few questions about an item, she wasn't very friendly or helpful. It seemed to be a chore to answer my questions and to have any interest in assisting me. It was a very unpleasant experience. 
The store ended up not having what I wanted, even though it was a common item and I'd seen it on Ulta's website as well. It's always frustrating and annoying when that is the case.   Sometimes I call a store first to see if they have a item in stock before I bother wasting my time and gas.   Of course I didn't do it this time, so that's just the way that goes.
I already had a few items in my hand and debated whether I just wanted to put them down and leave.  I decided to just rise above her unhelpful, unfriendly, poor, and pretentious attitude.    I looked around a little more, but felt overwhelmed by the fact that the store didn't have what I would consider a cohesively organized and logical layout.   I didn't think it was marked and/or lined out in an easy 'user friendly' fashion.  I decided to go ahead and check out shortly after that.  Thankfully the only friendly person in the store was at the register so that was refreshing. I'm not sure if I'll go back to Ulta.   Their prices were comparable to most prices I've seen elsewhere. Many of the things that I can get there I can get online as well if I wanted and really needed to.

Since then, I make a 30 minute drive to see her for all my facial needs. They do have girls who work in the ""brow bar"", but are never (every Ulta seems like they have that same issue) there, but I wouldn't trade my experience because I would have missed out on finding Octavia.

The store assistance itself has gotten much better. Every time I need help, someone is available (not lurking) to help & know directly where I can find what I need.

The mix of high end and drugstore products is great, since I can pick up everything I need in one shot instead of running all over. They also carry some harder-to-find brands like Japonesque and NYX. I have never used their salon at any location, so I can't speak to that service.

I find that Ulta in general is usually a much quieter store than a Sephora or MAC. The employees let me browse at my own pace, which I adore but I'm sure is not for some people such as those needing guidance or consultation. I'm very into makeup and skincare and don't need or want much help ever. I hate ""hoverers"" or pushy employees, so it's definitely a perk for me to be left alone. 

One employee here is a total standout. His name is Kevin, and he's on the taller side and a bit lanky. He is A-MAZ-ING!! If you ever need help, ask for Kevin. He knows his product like he knows his name, is never pushy, and will give you honest opinions (he's also a makeup artist).

The ""stylist"" was currently highlighting someone else's hair. Just started. I was only getting a blowout and style for pictures. I waited until 11:40. Another girl came over and took me to wash my hair. She took literally 25 minutes just to wash it. Then to blow dry it another 30 minutes. Finally the stylist came over to curl my ends with the flatiron. She pinned them up and asked if I could just take them down when I got home. I told her no, I was paying her to style my hair. I left there at 1:30. 
The next time I went in, after scheduling an appointment for color weeks ahead of time. An hour before I arrived, we got the call that my stylist was leaving to go home and could I reschedule a month later. No. So they scheduled me with a first timer. Well, I get there, show the girl what I wanted, and she consults the girl I was supposed to have in the first place!  Then she walks out with her boyfriend!  Angry already. Then this girl does my color and it's nowhere near what I wanted!  I've had it done many times at a salon in Pittsburgh. Never had an issue. I also asked for layers for my cut. I got a light trim.

The girl was clearly inexperienced and I could tell from the first 5 minutes but still let her continue (regret this now). My appointment was for 6:30 on a Friday. I arrived 10 mins early and was immediately taken which was a bonus.  She asked me what I wanted to do and I explained that I wanted all-over hair color to cover the grays (went into more detail regarding shade, etc), hair trim, and blow dry/style.  I waited while she mixed the color and watched her consult with who I assume was her manager (this made me a little nervous).  Let me tell you that this girl was S-L-O-W! It took her over an hour to apply color to my entire head (possibly 1.5) then she tells me ""Ok it has to stay on for 30 minutes"".  I said ""excuse me?"" (Cuz I've never had hair color stay on for that long especially when it took over an hour to apply). As I'm sitting there the salon is quickly emptying out so that by the time she says it's time to wash it out, there is not one customer there and only one other hairstylist who is also on her way out (its after 8 pm by now).  As I'm sitting in the shampoo chair she is washing my hair in the most gentle manner I've ever experienced and I'm thinking to myself ""How in the world is the hair color even washing out?"", not to mention how SLOWLY she's doing this too.  She FINALLY lets me up and I go over to the mirror knowing what I'm gonna find.  Firstly I notice my forehead is covered in dye then I run my hands through my hair and they come out covered in brown dye.  I turn to her and say, ""Um you didn't wash the dye out"" and show her my fingers.  Now I'm mad and I say ""I'm gonna wash my own hair"" and I proceed to do so while leaning over the sink scrubbing my scalp and hair (completely opposite of how she had done). As the water continues to run brown I ask her if this is supposed to happen and she replies that it's demi color so it's not permanent and is supposed to wash out some. Now I had no idea she hadn't put permanent dye in my hair so I'm even more pissed. I go over to the chair and she starts towel drying my hair ever so gently.  Then she starts combing it through and asks if I still want a haircut.  I answer no and she asks if I want t her to blow it out and again I tell her no.  As I'm getting up to leave I grab a towel since my hair is dripping wet.  I finish towel drying my hair and head to the register area.  I tell her I am supposed to get the promotional offer of 25% off, she applies it and I angrily storm off to pay (I regret paying anything now but there was no manager on sight at 8:30 pm anyway).

Twenty minutes before the bride was to walk down the aisle, she received a voicemail from Ulta, stating that I (a bridesmaid) did not pay for (fake) eyelashes when I checked out of the salon. And that if Ulta did not receive the $6 by the next day, that the police would be called. 

Seriously? Such an extreme measure for the mistake of your makeup ""artist,"" who rang the ticket up and forgot to add the eyelashes into the charge for the eyelash application and makeup? As a bridesmaid, I had about a dozen other things to worry about and thought that upon receiving the ticket and paying in full, that I was cleared. 

Wrong, due to someone else's mistake. 

And even worse, calling the BRIDE as she's about to head down the aisle, to threaten her with the police? 

Get a life. Our tips to the makeup ""artist"" not only would have paid for the lashes, but were also much more than what she deserved. Even oompa loompas looked better than I did before I scrambled back to the hotel to redo my makeup. 

And shame on Ulta, for taking a very unprofessional and childish approach to getting your $6.

Before she ever touched my hair, we had a long conversation about what I wanted (I had booked a full highlight and a cut). I wanted to bring up the color of my 2-year-old ombre into a warm balayage, which was listed under the highlight service. She asked ""how blonde"", so I showed her a picture of the exact balayage I wanted. She said that had been ""exactly what she had in mind,"" and we talked about how nice it would be for fall. 

I said I wanted to take off 2-3 inches, with a max of 3 inches coming from the bottom, because the hair was pretty broken and dead. She said she could definitely do that and asked how I like to style my hair day-to-day. I said I love throwing it into a messy bun at home, curling it or straightening it for work, and sometimes just wearing it naturally curly by tossing it over one side of my head. I said I wanted layers cut back in because most had grown out. She had cut my hair before and it was nice, so there were no red flags. (Yet?)

Back to the color, she said how good long, choppy layers would look with the balayage I was going for. I had no reason to doubt that I wasn't going to get what I asked for--she went on and on about how good it was going to look once the color in my hair was refreshed.

When she took the foils out at the sink, she commented about how wonderfully my hair had lightened up. It hadn't been colored in nearly two years, so I knew it should've worked well since the dye was mostly on virgin hair. But then she said she wanted to make the color ""pop"" more, and would I be okay with her ""deepening the root"" with a little bit of dye? I trusted that she knew what she was doing, so I said it was fine. I thought maybe she had brought the balayage up a little too far and needed to touch it up to shadow the roots a bit. I stayed in the sink for another half hour while that dye set, and then we went back to the chair.

I was confused in the chair because even though my hair was wet, I couldn't see any signs of color. I thought I should've been able to see some of the warm blonde at the bottom, but there wasn't anything to be seen. It's okay, though, I thought, because I've colored my full head and barely been able to tell when it was wet. I'd wait until it was dry before making a judgment.

I didn't have any doubt about her ability to cut my hair, because I've been to her for a cut before. So when she came to the side and showed me where she intended to start cutting--about three inches from the bottom--I wasn't concerned. Until she was still trimming off bits from the bottom 20 minutes later, and I realized my hair had lost NEARLY SIX INCHES. I started to panic a little bit, but wanted to wait until she was finished. 

Maybe the layers would redeem it and it would be fine. Hair grows back, right? Maybe we'd had a miscommunication about the length? I didn't know it at the time ended up taking off all of my remaining ombre. I don't know how she interpreted ""I want to bring this color up since I'll lose some of it in the trim"" into ""take all of this color off."" But once she had dried my hair, I was shocked to see that not only had she taken SIX INCHES off, but it was also all one length. No layers to be seen. 

And the color? No slow, gradual transition from warm blonde to my natural dark brown. Just cool blonde highlights from top to bottom, throughout my entire head. And, as I later realized, the highlights aren't evenly spaced... and some have missing brown chunks where the brown dye was unevenly layered over the blonde during the shadow root touch-up.

I wondered if it was the salon lighting that was making me see things. I let her finish styling it, as she gushed about how it's ""still long"" even though it was barely touching my shoulders when it had formerly gone halfway down my back. I stupidly paid $$$ + tip for this absolute destruction of my hair.

Let's recap.

I asked for:
- a warm blonde balayage
- a maximum of 3"" cut off the length
- layers

I got:
- cool-toned root-to-tip highlights
- darker roots on formerly virgin hair, which will now be difficult to color over
- A minimum of SIX INCHES off of my hair, which will take over a year to grow back
- an all-one-length cut

Was it opposite day? Because I feel like I somehow came out on the other side of the cupboard in Narnia with a bad haircut.

The salon manager contacted me, offering to fix it, and told me if I couldn't get there in one to two weeks (I'm from out of town), she could give me 20% off my next service. I thought about going back, but ultimately decided it would be better to go somewhere else rather than risk it getting even worse. 

I asked Ulta for a partial refund for this nightmare, but haven't heard back. I'm not holding my breath.

When we finally got in everyone rushed in different directions. It wasn't until I was in the store for 10 more minutes that someone finally came over to see if I needed help with anything.

I was turned out to Derm when I started working at my current place of employment and was surrounded by it every day.

She went on and on and I just kept smiling while looking through the products. Then out of no where she starts saying things that I know to be down right wrong about the products and at the point she had my full attention. I know that everyone can't know everything but to lie to try and keep a conversation going? My husband knew right away I was started to become annoyed and finally I asked her to walk up and let her know that she was completely wrong and she should never give someone the advice she tried to give me.

RoWVC_rLZ85fFJrw6G8urg,qDHInkhNalPHQi8rYi9kjA,2.0,"Okay, so it's a chain store. But I've been to enough Ulta locations to know what separates one from another: the staff. Maybe the few times I've been here just all happen to coincide with an 'off' day for the employees, but it seems like there's only ever one person here at any given time who actually cares about not completely alienating potential customers. 

The last time I visited this location, I went with the intention of getting my eyebrows waxed. The seemingly lone salon employee said that she was busy with another client and wouldn't be able to assist me for at least 20 minutes. Okay, that's totally understandable. The (suspiciously empty) salon apparently had just one person staffing it, as it WAS in the late afternoon.

Imagine my surprise when I watched her leave the salon immediately after telling me she was busy. Imagine my further surprise when, upon exiting the store a few minutes later, I saw the same employee smoking and chatting away outside, looking like she had no intention of doing her job any time soon. 

The few minutes I spent browsing the store were quiet minutes, as not one store employee seemed interested in helping me find this item or notifying me of whatever current sale was going on. I spent one college summer working at another Ulta location and, let me tell you, we were told that satisfactory customer service was our top priority. In that regard, this location brings the fail quite spectacularly, as well-stocked as it may be.

But I'd have to say it's their SERVICE that will keep me from returning ever again.  I'm not a huge consumer of these products, but maybe 2-3 times a year I'll drop a $100 each time.  About a year ago I received a % coupon from Sephora.  I had a few other errands to run in the same center as ULTA so I brought my Sephora coupon  along and asked if they'd honor the competitor coupon for the same products.  ""No-"" was their curt answer.  There was no offer or suggestion of maybe what they ""could"" do otherwise to earn my business. Just, ""No"" and a stare.   I left, and went to Sephora, who earned my money. Out of convience, I had other shopping to do in this same strip mall, once again.  I grabbed a cart and knocked off each errand along this outside mall while loading each purchase bag I made in the same cart (I know I was cart-double-dipping-lol!)  I also was carrying my 10 month old son in this cart as well (multi-tasking!)  I was ready to give ULTA another try.  As I was browsing the new fall nail colors, a somewhat stern blonde employee quickly approached me and asked me to please leave with my cart.  She explained that although she saw I was pushing an infant and was hauling other bags that their ""shelves were not designed nor sturdy enough in the event I pushed into one with my cart"".  Maybe if she had offered to hold my bags behind the counter, or helped me with my purchases while I used my hands to hold my son, I would have stayed.  But again, there was NO effort made to keep or earn my dollar.  There was no apology for the situation.  Not even a half-ass compassion attempt.  My happy little boy, wallet and I walked our butt out of ULTA for the very last time.  (While passing a woman and her baby in a stroller- so how is THAT exactly less of a shelf hazard than the cart I was pushing???) 
Especially in todays economy it's no excuse to be this poor with customer service.  Thank goodness for capitalism. And thank goodness for the Sally Beauty Supply next door to ULTA.

I've always wanted to get dermabrasion but I have been thrown off by this price. This seemed reasonable so I was excited to try it out. I barely felt a thing as she was doing it. I would compare it to rubbing an eraser across my face. On top of that there was the entire facial with a mask and aromatherapy

I thought my skin was worse than it was but Chana let me know it was more that I was dehydrated. I guess the one downside is that my skin felt so good I wanted to buy the whole dermalogica line. I will definitely be back!",2016,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,4

Ah2Mp3qE2_fKHPugkkNCsA,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,1.0,"I have been going to Ulta for over 15 years. This is my hometown location where I have been getting my hair, facials, and eyebrows done since I was about 16 years old. I am now 32. My mother and I are loyal patrons, loyalty card holders, and repeat salon clients. I skip Aveda, and Sephora, as I have always preferred Ulta for their prices and quality of services. At this location, Donna did my hair for over 10 years, and since her departure from the store, I have entrusted my problematic locks to the talented Gina for about 2 years. I used to even wait until I would be in town from Miami to get my haircuts! 

Yesterday evening I was in the store shopping and saw that the brow bar was empty so I requested a wax service and was told they had immediate availability. I can honestly tell you that the associate's skill level was questionable (at best) from the beginning, although she was completely polite and professional. She put the wax on far too delicately for it to cover correctly. She also didn't use enough wax, and spent too long pressing it in. (by the time she actually pulled the strip off my face the wax was likely completely cool) I didn't say anything because I figured everyone has their approach and I am a brow bar loyalist (I trust that they are properly trained). She was well into applying concealer (incorrectly) when I myself reached for the hand mirror, since she had not offered to show me my brows at all, post-waxing. I was mortified. Not a single hair that I walked into the store with that evening was missing. It looked only like someone had made my brows red, not that I had had a wax. I showed her the many, many hairs that she missed and she reapplied wax and tried again. Again, too little wax, pressing too light and for too long, and the hairs remained. I pointed it out to her, and she said she would get her manager. That took an easy 15 minutes so I just sat there with the exact same eyebrow growth I had when I walked in. Frankly I didn't know what else to say to the associate. She clearly didn't know what she was doing, and I didn't want to risk any skin over this by allowing her to apply a THIRD attempt. It was awkward, as these encounters can be, but she really was sweet and I think she expected the manager to handle things appropriately. 

The manager, Lynn, came over and told me that the hairs were too short for the wax to ""catch"". I've never heard such a dismissive load of BS in my life. I have had my eyebrows waxed maybe 100 times in my life. At this Ulta location, several in south Florida, and plenty of private salons and spas. The hairs were not ""too short."" That is an outrageous thing to claim. A good wax job should get ALL hairs; long, medium, short, baby, and fuzz. I have gone in to that EXACT location with LESS brow growth and come out with clean, hairless brows. She kept repeating that I could just have the associate ""pluck them."" EXCUSE ME? Um...I can pluck my own eyebrows at home, and believe me, do a better job with tweezers than this associate. I came for a WAX. I was being charged for a WAX. The associate mentioned to me twice that she was new, and apologized, and frankly I don't hold her ultimately responsible. She does need better training, but the decision to charge me all but 20% of my service was left to the unprofessional manager who just lost a lifetime Ulta customer over a pitiful $15. 

I spent over $130 on products yesterday, and a fortune over the years. I even brought my bridal party to this location on my wedding day for our hair services. BOTH cashiers at checkout 100% agreed with me that my brows absolutely were not waxed correctly and they both extended their condolences. They had no choice but to charge me what the manager instructed. I was ultimately charged $15 for my $21 service and not only are my brows WORSE  than they were before walking into Ulta, (since now I'll have to wait a few days to get them waxed correctly) but I am completely turned off from this brand. Every gal knows you can walk into any corner nail salon and get a decent brow wax for about $8. I chose to pay the Ulta premium because it has always been my experience that their brow bar associates are suedo-experts in the trade and the Ulta brand takes care of its clients. I have requested to be reimbursed by corporate, but this taste in my mouth will be difficult to overcome. The economic temperature in America right now is not such that business owners and managers should take the liberty to make clients feel so devalued. I live in Channelside and drove across town to get to my favorite little beauty store in Citrus Park. When someone is making that kind of effort, and spending this kind of money, you only have to disappoint them once. Hope that fifteen bucks was worth it, Lynn.",2017,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,8

Half the time they don't even have displays for the latest Essie, OPI or China Glaze collections and when they do, they are always  1/2 empty, picked over and just sad.  While they send out great coupons, my savings are usually lessened by having to go to 2 or 3 locations just to find $10 or $15 of product I actually want so I can use the darned coupon.  If I could rate them 1.5 stars I would, because I find it absurd that you have to carefully check each and every nail polish before you buy it as there are frequently  1/2 empty bottles in the racks.

However, if more testers had been available I probably wouldn't have had to return some of those products today. I did some price matches with the Amazon app and found some that were cheaper here and some cheaper on Amazon. Sometimes it was a big difference so you might want to get the app. Speaking of apps, ulta's is pretty good. I got a coupon for $3.50 off a $10 purchase! Before I went here yesterday, I signed up for their rewards club. Get 1 point for every $1 spent. Spend $450/yr get 1.25 points for every $1 spent + you get some free gifts. When you make returns, the points earned on those products are deducted from your rewards balance. I made my return on four items today and had no problem at all. Great return policy: you can't have used more than 25% of the product and it has to be within 60 days of purchase.

I feel like one of this store's biggest problems is that whenever I'm looking for a specific color, they always seem to be out of it.  It makes me think the person responsible for ordering does not check the stock on a frequent enough basis.

I will say that during my most recent visit, when they were out of a color I wanted, a store representative made the excellent suggestion to get the particular shade I wanted in an eye shadow version, as it could be used as an eye liner (which they were out of), and she was 100% correct.

bAmK1OzZpDkKeN_az63sMw,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,2.0,"The only thing that keeps me going back to Ulta's is that it has a benefit brow bar inside. However, over the past few years, I've noticed that the benefit brow bar experience tends to always be better when they're inside a Macy's or department store than an Ulta Beauty. 

This particular Ulta is right by my house, which is the only reason why I've given this place a try. I've tried to call and set up a brow bar appointment no less than at least 10 times and have never been able to successfully reach someone at the brow bar to set a time. Finally, I just gave up trying to call and showed up to try and get a walk in appointment at the brow bar.

I walked in, no one greeted me, and then I stood and waited at the brow bar while they were finishing their service for about 10-15 minutes, and then someone walked up before me while I was standing there and cut in for a service, and was then ""put in line"" before me. I then promptly approached the brow bar and let them know that I had been waiting for them for the past 10-15 minutes for them to finish up before approaching them, even though it was obvious that they had noticed I was waiting the entire time, and still said that I would have to wait until after the next person who just walked up. It was absolutely infuriating. They mentioned that I should have made an appointment, to which I let them, I've tried relentlessly, but had never been able to reach the brow bar, and had been on hold for 15 minutes at a time before I just gave up and took my business elsewhere. The associate at the brow bar wasn't the most friendly and was sick as well. 

When checking out, the associate asked if I wanted to use anyone else's Ulta membership when checking out, even though I know it's store policy as well to use other peoples reward accounts because it's supposed treated like ""using someone else's credit card"". 

While this store is one of the larger ones that I've been to with more high end options like MAC and so forth, the customer service is just abismal and I will continue to take my business and brow needs to a different benefit brow bar elsewhere.",2018,IN,Indiana,28.0637143005,-82.5754135528,Y,3

The store is pretty cramped but easy enough to navigate. The salon is toward the back left and is always booming with customers. Everyone in there seems to be having a good time. The floor associates are always courteous and quick to ask if I need any help. And I mean really quick. I know exactly where my shampoo is, make a beeline for it, then pull a sick 180 toward the cash register. And they still manage to get a word in.

The registers are my only problem with the store. Think of a HomeGoods or Marshall's line of registers without the defined queue. This results in customers who, shall we say, think less intuitively about queue flow, and force the line down actual store aisles instead of snaking it around where it should go. This could be easily solved by adding a roped-off section specifically for the queue. The store is so packed full of end caps and shelves anyway, that removing something toward the registers would solve two problems at once.

While I don't go to this store more than about twice a year, it's not an experience I dread. They always have what I'm looking for, and they deliver coupons semi-frequently. Not a bad place to physically shop for beauty products in Citrus Park at all.

As a side-note, one irking thing about Ulta in general is that they press you for your phone number more than any other business I've been to.

The girls are really nice and willing to offer help if needed, though unfortunately I feel like some of them are not fully trained. Love that I can get both drugstore and higher quality cosmetics in one place, it saves me having to make the trip to both CVS and Sephora in one day.

I went in today to get a new foundation and a few other things, and the one thing that really stood out to me(making this 2 stars) was that there were soooo many messy and gross displays. There were at least 5 items I wanted to purchase but they were down to the last item with the package broken open and obviously used. When I got home I opened up one of the things I got(a box containing a few different goodies) and one of the products inside had been obviously used. Really? Never happened at Sephora or even at Target, CVS, etc. Thankfully it was just a powder so I can scratch off the top layer and sanitize it with alcohol, but I'll never buy anything that isn't SEALED from them again. Sometimes at Sephora I feel like the girls are hovering over me or following me, maybe the girls at Ulta need to get it together and start doing that so people stop being gross with their products. Catch them in the act and tell them to stop, seriously. I'd rather be followed around than be unable to buy products because they're used. The store is pretty big and I just really don't think they have enough people walking the floor.

Also today a man(maybe the owner?) was going around screaming about the renovations and complaining about people swatching nail polishes on the displays. Literally I was at the back of the store and he was at the front and I could hear him loud and clear. Not exactly a relaxing shopping experience.

I felt extremely self cautious at first when I arrived because literally everyone in the store has flawless skin. I started walking around the aisles of the up line makeup brands (I normally stick with drug store brands, but I needed a change!) Right away, a young girl with a beautiful smile came over and asked if I needed help. I felt at ease right away. I explained to her my situation about not getting coverage when I have an allergy outbreak and right away she belted off brands that would have full coverage yet it wouldn't make me look like I caked on a bunch of makeup to cover up. She had me sit in a chair while she searched for the right color. It took about 3-4 times to find the right shade, but my skin never has looked happier with makeup! For foundation, we went with Urban Decay All Nighter. It's waterproof but easy to wipe off with either makeup remover or a wipe. The setting powder is loose and it's by Tarte. My concealer is amazing and hides everything from a blemish to bags under the eye. This product is by Tarte as well and it's the shape tape.

I would have to guess that this has to be the buyer is not ordering enough product to meet the demand.  But it isn't just high demand products, many items have very low stock as well. I expect this to happen from time to time, especially with a new store, but this a habitual issue. 
  The other issue I have is the last time I went in there were a lot of promotional displays that were blocking pathways and this was made worse by three female employees congregating right in the middle of the walk path to the registers and exit while they laughed and joked, completely obvious to anyone else around them.

I heard a loud voice yell from about 15 feet away ""YOU READY?!"" It was the cashier closest to the entrance. I politely said yes and walked over. At first I just assumed maybe I wasn't paying attention, or maybe I didn't hear her the first time even tho I was actually In a hurry to get rung up because my little family and I were headed for the corn maze. When I reached the register The cashier didn't greet me, she said in a very stern manner ""do you have a phone number on file?"".... that's when I knew whatever this attitude was, it was directed intentionally towards me. I said yes and gave her my number. I also had a digital coupon on my phone, she saw it and scanned it and gave me a pretty annoyed look.

1. To get my free birthday gift
2. To try out the It Cosmetics brand. 
I browsed around the store looking at all the make up goodies & scoped  out the girl who had the best makeup application on herself. I found Rachael.  I explained to her that my skin has become totally strange since moving to Idaho 8 months ago. I told her that I was interested in the It line, but I was also open to other brands. We discussed what I needed as far as coverage as well as the overall condition of my skin.  She told me that It would be a good brand for me.  She asked if I wanted her to apply some to see how it looked & I happily accepted. She used minimal amounts of the make up & made my skin look gorgeous in less than 10 minutes.  She answered ALL of my questions without a hint of attitude. She was very knowledgeable of all of the product lines & I appreciated that a lot! 
After she finished applying the makeup I looked in the mirror and was floored! It looked great!  She didn't use a ton of product & she explained everything she was doing as she applied it.  I'm pretty confident that I will be able to replicate what she did. I love how my skin looks and feels.

M5BnrbRCxk2RSRywjhgJdg,6ZdgPekv8DEvwLmh66wJIQ,5.0,"Surprisingly,  this was my FIRST time an Ulta store! The bright lights against the white monochrome decor had me hypnotized as I wandered through aisle after aisle of beautiful makeup and skincare products. I wanted it all! Luckily, I had visited the Ulta website earlier in the day and came across an amazing Free Gift with Purchase offer with $88 that actually had some really great stuff in it, and in colors I will actually use!!
I wenr in at 8:40pm, and although the store closes at 9pm, I didn't get any sort of attitude from any of the 3 employees that said Hi to me and all very politely and professionally asked if I needed help finding anything.  At first I was fine and didn't need help. Right up front I spotted the Ulta Brand and laid eyes upon the gorgeous warm toned neutral palette by Miss Fabulous, a YouTube beauty blogger that made this particular palette as a collaboration with Ulta! I grabbed that and one of their Ulta Brand Automatic Lip Liners in ""Rose"", which is an awesome rose pink that I would consider ""nude"" and can be used as a liner with many different lip product shades. The eyeshadow pallete was $20 and the liner was $8. Fair prices for the Ulta Brand. 
I love that there are an abundance of testers out!!
I suddenly remembered that I have been wanting to get a Beauty Blender! Yes, the little pink secret weapon of girls, boys, and Drag Queens everywhere!  I asked the very sweet girl behind the back counter, I think it was a makeover/spa counter of some sort, if she could just point me in the direction of the Beauty Blenders! I would have been cool with her literally pointing in the direction or even just telling me the aisle number! But this top notch Ulta employee WALKED ME ALL THE WAY OVER TO IT! And it was on the opposite side of the store from us, too! 
Unfortunately,  Ulta does NOT carry the original, actual Beauty Blender brand of makeup sponge. However, being a ""Girl-in-the-Know"", I was aware that the ""Real Techniques"" sponge is the closest dupe and that's just what they had! The Real Techniques are $10.99 for TWO blenders, unlike the original Beauty Blender, which is $20 for ONE! Also, the RT blender has a FLAT side, which seems like it would press that foundation in Tony our skin better, and it has a sharper point at the top for really getting that concealer right up against your under eye area! I've yet to try the RT sponge, but let me know if anyone reading this wants an ""update"" as to how the RT makeup blending sponge or anything I purchased worked out!
So, I qualified for their FGWP and received a cute little makeup bag with $88 worth of Ulta Brand Makeup in it for FREE!! And it's in colors that I will actaully use! I can list what was in the bag in an ""update"", too.!
I was so excited and overwhelmed by my shopping experience that I completely forgot to use the $3.50 Off purchase of Ulta Brand worth $21 Or More that I had printed off from the Ulta website earlier in the day. 
Thr girl at the register looked up my ""Ultimate Rewards"" card info by my phone number as it wasn't pulling up on my cell phone. You get One Point for every $1 you spend, PRETAX!!! 100 points is worth $3.00. That's a pretty generous rewards system! She was also very nice and helpful and I enjoyed chatting with her while she rang me up. She was even nice enough to show me a whole chart that shows the scale of your Rewards and what they are with dollar amount wise. I wish I would have asked and/or remembered all of their names!! Since I came in 20 minutes before closing, I really did expect to be treated with a sour attitude and not receive any help. I am beyond satisfied and impressed with how each employee treated me and when they found out it was my first time in an Ulta, they were even excited for me, joked around with me, and we briefly discussed our mutual love of all things makeup!  What a great staff at this location!
I will definitely be returning to this particular Ulta to make future makeup and skincare purchases for the foreseeable future!! 
I highly suggest that before going into the store,  take some time and look over the Ulta website and check out their sales,  new arrivals, and special offers and FGWP!! I wouldn't have known about the free bag of stuff if I hadn't visited the website!  And, USE YOUR REWARDS CARD!!! Earn points and benefit from buying higher end makeup, it all adds up very quickly! 
I am super stoked I FINALLY stepped foot into one of the two Makeup Meccas! 
We will see if the other store can even hold a candle to the wonderful employees here! I will most definitely be calling the store later and informing the Manager of my positive experience here!

May your eyeshadow not fade, may your concealer never crease, and may your eyebrows always be on Fleek! 

I highly recommend shopping this Ulta location my fellow Makeup Addicts!!

pCVdl5RZ4PNfel3wzQxm6Q,6ZdgPekv8DEvwLmh66wJIQ,2.0,I went to the Ulta Salon in sparks on Oct have Sharla cut my hair. While she was friendly I was shocked to see the back of my hair when she was done. It looks like Moe of the 3 stooges. Right in the mid back of my hair it looks like a bowl cut! I brought her several pictures of how my hair is cut and she went wild with the back. I hate the back of my neck and always have the back of my hair the same length but she cut it up high with the sides hanging down.

She fixes my brows and made them look the way they should have been. She gives good tips on make up and how to do your brows.
I guess my only complaint is that a few weeks ago on my first visit she wanted me to grow out a certain part of my brows. Then on my most recent visit she waxed all the new growth off!  I know she sees a lot of people but it would have been nice had she kept consistent advice. I will be back because she does a stellar job!",2013,DE,Delaware,39.5811881345,-119.7406767411,Y,3

One time I even got a free Coconut Body Butter from the Body Shop line.  I was pretty stoked.

In this case it was hair.  I had just moved up from LA and had been in town for only three weeks.  I had a second interview coming up with a high profile tech company and my fine, curly hair was looking pretty ragged.

My last hair dresser, who I had been going to for around 10 years has hair that is similar to my own, so she got me.  Plus, she became a good friend.  She had also styled industry people on set at the Golden Globes, cut hair for actors/models, but mostly high level celebrity's assistants/attorneys/publicists.  My point: she is amazing.

Back to my situation- I didn't have much time.  My mom's hair always looks nice and she has a great head of hair (no extensions) for being a senior.  I chose to go to her hair dresser, Raquel.

It turns out Raquel has thick, wavy/curly hair too.  She is great at what she does!  She touched up my roots, did a conditioning thing and a blowdry.  I got 3 compliments before I even paid my bill!  I loved that she trimmed my ends just the tiniest bit, as I like to keep my hair long.

I'm not taking off a full star, but more a quarter: we were both feeling kind of tired and stressed, so the energy was a little low.  Next time, I'll make sure I have caffeine with me.

While the Ulta store location on S.

Two weekends ago, I went to the Virginia St. location, hoping to use my $5 off of $15 coupon, but both items I was looking for were not there.

Mercedes is still there and does amazing brows at the Benefit Brow Bar. She is also fabulous at helping me test out products that are new to me. I highly recommend stopping by the Benifit counter to chat with her.

There is a new Clinique counter which is wonderful! I love the way it is set up and I find it much more user friendly than the counter at department stores. There are LOTS of disposable applicators so you can try pretty much everything! Love it.

M5BnrbRCxk2RSRywjhgJdg,6ZdgPekv8DEvwLmh66wJIQ,5.0,"I came into Ulta today as I had a gift card, a 20% Off One Item coupon, AND I got a FREE Urban Decay Eyeshadow single in ""Midnight Cowboy"", a very pretty pinkish, sparkly shade, a $19 value for FREE because it was my birthday a few days ago! I also received a FREE can of SexyHair texturizing hair spray! It seems to be either a Travel Size or Deluxe Sample Size. It's a pretty darn good size for being free and I didn't even know I was gonna get it! Cool!!!
I was alone, so I really took my time looking around at all of the pretty makeup. It's like Heaven for me. As I walked around, every now and then an employee would very kindly asked me if I needed help, and while about 3 employees asked me this, I never felt pressured or bothered. In fact, I engaged in quite a few pleasant conversations about makeup and skincare with each person and it was nice to talk to people that share the same level of passion and love for makeup and all things beauty that I do!
One employee, I didn't get her name, a very nice and gorgeous older woman that seemed to be designated to the Too Faced/Urban Decay area even went to the other side of the store to see if Soap & Glory had any of their cosmetics In Store yet, and while she didn't see that there was in fact a small shipper display of about 15 products, she was still very, very helpful and we actually talked for 10 minutes about how awesome Clinique is! I'm a nerd, I know. I didn't get upset that this lady didn't see the Soap & Glory display as it was tucked into a weird place about 3 rows into the HAIRCARE section!  Lol
I ended up getting the Makeup Revolution Neutrals vs New-trals eyeshadow palette for $8.00 after my 20% off coupon, and it's GORGEOUS! There were also a bunch of, and Im talkimg about 90% of the display, of Palladio that was on Clearance right now! I only paid $3.50 for a Velvet Matte Lip Cream, $1.50 for a Lip Liner, and only $2 for a Felt Tip Brown Liquid Eyeliner! I estimate that I saved Iaround $15 to $20! I was bummed that I wasn't able to apply the 20%off coupon to the  $18 Clinique Lip Gloss I was getting.  Sounds like a lot for one lip gloss, but it's in ""Black Honey"" which is a Cult Classic in the beauty world! 
I was surprised at the lack of Holiday Sets, especially from Too Faced! They are known for their Holiday sets, and only a few of the smaller ones were in the store! I fully expected to see the whole kit-n-kaboodle on display. Maybe it will all be out on display closer to Christmas? 
I love that I earn 1 Point for each dollar I spend,  pretax. I have over 100 points right now and could have redeemed it for $3 towards my purchase, but I want to save up a whole bunch and put it towards a higher end eyeshadow palette.  
I love Ulta. I love this store and yet again, every single staff member I came in contact with was pleasant and professional! I enjoy coming to THIS location very much.
I think the Ulta on South Virginia might be a little bigger, but I'm willing to sacrifice selection for great customer service. I've heard that the employees at that the S. Virginia location aren't as nice and helpful. And ya know what? I can ways order stuff online. 
The cost of makeup adds up fast and some of it is very expensive, I'm talking $50 for ONE eyeshadow palette!
But, makeup is my love, my obsession, and the most fun and beautiful way in the world that I can express myself and create art and beauty on my face each day!
I'm really glad that I am able to interact with such lovely people in the staff at the Spanish Springs Ulta! Even if it's a bit longer of a drive for you, I highly recommend that you come to this location as I assure you that the staff will help you with anything you need, they are all awesome, and it's always an enjoyable and pleasant experience! 
Thank you to the staff here!  I will be back again soon!

She told me I would need to send her a snip it of the texts because that is not what her system says my appointment is.  I was appalled, she was basically calling me a liar and asking for proof of the text messages. I expressed this to her and she sarcastically said I'm sorry we can schedule you for another day. She proceeded to say they were having system issues. I responded how was that my issue and now I have to reschedule. Doing our whole conversation she spoke to me rudely. I told her she needs customer service training.  I asked to speak to her manager, she said she was on vacation and she would send me her email just before she rudely commented have a nice day and hung up on me.

0OnqSvyblod55eNNmnn4BQ,6ZdgPekv8DEvwLmh66wJIQ,4.0,"This review is for the Benefit Brow Bar located within this Ulta.

My method of eyebrow grooming for years was threading. I have pretty sensitive skin so I transitioned from plucking them myself straight to threading, skipping waxing as I've always heard it can wreck a havoc on your skin if it's sensitive. Unfortunately for me, any method of eyebrow grooming tends to be a very painful experience for me. As much as I love the final product, I have definitely left some salons red-eyed with tears streaming down my face due to the sheer pain that threading puts me through.

I then moved to Reno and couldn't find a good threading place to go to. I had heard talk about the Brow Bar and how they work wonders on your eyebrows, but I was always hesitant to go since they wax. They also provide a plucking service if you are not into waxing, but plucking is just as painful as threading for me - if not more!

So I sucked it up and went to the closest place near me with a Brow Bar, and it was the Ulta in Sparks. I have since had a second appointment and I can say that I much, much, MUCH prefer the Brow Bar to threading. This is my first foray into waxing so I can't compare how other estheticians may wax, but all pulling the strip off does is make me flinch a little, and that's about it. Compared to how I death-grip the chair and cry for the duration that a cotton string is pulling rows of hair out of my face, the wax is nice and warm, and doesn't hurt at all when pulled off.

Both times my eyebrows were done by Mercedes - it seems she is the only one working the Brow Bar at this location? - but she is amazing, super friendly, and really easy to hold a conversation with. I don't normally like talking when I'm at a salon but she is great. She also will put makeup on at the end to fill in your eyebrows if needed/cover up any redness. My skin so far has not reacted at all to the wax, which is super awesome on my end, and lets me keep coming back every 6-8 weeks to get my eyebrows done. It is $20 a pop, which is more than what I paid to have my eyebrows threaded, but I think the comfort level (for me) is worth paying extra.",2012,DE,Delaware,39.5811881345,-119.7406767411,Y,11

We got there at 1pm and waited for another 15 mins before we got taken cared of. It took 45 mins for dad to be done with his haircut, their clipper was broken and the hairdresser nicked his neck.

That said, one of the wonderful line of products we were introduced to during our stay were H20 Plus line of personal spa care. We felt that the products complimented well the well appointed suite we stayed in.
They helped provide a very enriching and relaxing experience. They had H20 Plus
Shampoo, Conditioner and Body Butter. We loved the Shampoo and my wife assured me that although I don't condition my hair often my scalp would thank me and my hair would feel and look better if I tried it and she was so right.. 
The body butter was amazing and we agreed we wanted to get these products to use at home.

We had no idea how difficult it would be to find these 'Spa' grade products that are apparently provided on many luxury cruise ships.
We found on the H20 Plus website that ULTA was supposed to carry the H20 Plus line and headed over to see if we could find the ones we had gotten at the Inn we stayed at.

We were overwhelmed upon arrival at all they had to offer, (and guys it's much more 'a woman's store but that doesn't mean they don't have products for us to use as well). Unfortunately we could not find the H20 Plus Shampoo or Conditioner but they did carry the H20 Plus Body Butter (at $25 for an 8oz tube it's a bit spendy but worth it).

We were a bit disappointed that they didn't carry the Shampoo but at least we found the Body Butter.

The staff were friendly enough- but seemed a bit aloof.

We hope they start carrying the rest of the H20 Plus line so that we don't need to order on-line which is the only way we were able to get the Shampoo/Conditioner.

We would definitely go back for these products for the convenience. But as it stands the price for the Body Butter is the same on-line at Amazon or at the H20 Plus website so we may as well just purchase all three products on-line.",2014,DE,Delaware,39.5811881345,-119.7406767411,Y,3

Close to my house, no pushy sales reps, Mercedes in the Browbar is great, and I never have a problem with the products i need not being in stock.

Although, I will be honest , most of my review is towards Mercedes in the Benefit BrowBar.

I have never done my brows before nor waxed them . So I was pretty nervous about coming down.
I also knew there was places that were cheaper to get them waxed but at the same time I heard stories about people making their eyebrows too thin.

I finally gave it a shot and made a appointment with Mercedes. Came in and I let her know this was my first time for my brows in general and she was completely amazing from beginning to end. She described the procedure to me and the side effects I might get after then when it finally came to the waxing , she made sure I was relaxed and comfortable before starting to wax.

At the end of everything she taught me how to fill in my brows and how to shape them and helped me pick the right color for my brows. I was very pleased with the service and at the end didn't mind spending the extra money just because it was worth the experience.

A few months later , I came back to her and same exact perfect Customer Service from Mercedes, and to top it off she gave me a little test benefit browmade to try out.

Not only is she a very skilled stylist, she's both professional and personable. When I came to her I was in need of some color help-she was the second person I saw in the area. Maryn was able to take my hair back to a more natural brunette without issue even though she's amazing with blonds! She's great at directing me towards products that will actually work for my hair type and not just something super pricy. I have extremely thick curly hair and she's one of only a handful of people that manages to straighten it without a flat iron and a ton of products. She's also amazing with my eyebrows! When you find a person that you love, you MUST share their information...so go visit the Ulta in Warrington and ask for Maryn specifically. She's probably the one smiling ear to ear, laughing, and having a great time with her clients making them look fabulous!!",2018,IN,Indiana,40.232041,-75.1354302654,Y,3

She took her time washing my hair and even worked in a great scalp massage. After the cut, she  taught me how to dry and style my hair for the look that I was wanting to achieve. Afterward, she provided me with an estimate for some color that I was thinking of getting, and also walked me through the store to recommend the best products for my new style.

The hairstylist wasn't apologetic. She said the salon lights were the culprit but I can't see the highlights in direct sunlight either. The haircut was good but I won't be back.

It was actually a very strange day, considering I've always gotten consistently bad to almost mediocre service whenever I step inside this store. I've been to an Ulta in Schaumburg and that was a completely refreshing experience!

Anyway, Ulta is a pretty neat concept for a beauty store because they carry some high end beauty products as well as those you can easily find at the drugstore.  So whatever your fancy, chances are they might have it. They carry anything from make-ups to perfumes, hair products and random beauty accessories! It really can be a one-stop shop for a woman or man concerned with their personal grooming.

The thing I probably like to oogle at when I come here are the shelves of travel-sized products.  They are a great way to try something new and different without committing yourself to a product you might hate.   And if you do end up loving it, you can always come back and buy a bigger one!

Customer service is almost non-existent unfortunately. I've been here multiple times and no greetings when I come in during all of my visits. Yes, there were associates standing around by the door conversing amongst themselves.  I once came in and looked around for a new foundation to try back when I was in-between foundation brands and got no help from anyone so I ended up going to Sephora instead.

v0ukNtkeHk_KtPSKOT_lSA,qPohxPukFHiTsQ5wFQa0FQ,1.0,"This is for the salon service I received on Feb 2. I am pretty disappointed with how my experience went down.

I arrived 6 minutes later from my scheduled appointment so my apologies for that. All the stylists were busy with someone including the person that I had booked my appointment with. Of course that was no biggie. That's how it can get in a salon and I was late for my appointment so simply I just had to wait. There's a chair available to sit right next to the counter so that's where I settled. Several ladies asked me if I needed help or if I've been helped and I told them that I have an appointment with .... at 2 so I'm just waiting for her to finish. I waited an hour until she finished with her client and that didn't even bother me at all.. the one thing that put the icing on the cake for this whole thing was that by the time my stylist was finished and I am still sitting on the same chair I hear her coming and as she's printing out the receipt with her client as she's with another stylist at the computer, the other lady tells my stylist ""this person never showed up"" and my stylist says ""ohh really? Well that's fine just cancel her. She was a kind of a weird one anyway. Let's get so and so set up for her next appointment."" Right then and there I wanted to get up and leave. I couldn't believe what I just heard... I guess they did not even know I was sitting right there. After several seconds the other stylist asks me ""are you antoinette?"" And I turned to her and said yes. Both of the ladies gasp and my stylist looks at me and says ""no way! Everyone was telling me that they you never showed up. It's ok I can take you right now."" I told them both ""I don't know why they would tell you that because several lady's came up to me and asked me what I was here for and I've been sitting here since 2 and even advised I was a bit late"" I wanted to tell her off and say that I don't know why you would still take me in anyway to do service if you just called me weird. My birthday is the next day and I really wanted to get my hair done because it's been way overdue and I was in a good mood so I just went in to get it done. Mind you I've seen this stylist before who cut my sons hair on Christmas Eve which I was so grateful for because all salons were closing early and she happened to be one that would wait out for me and that was still in to help anyone when I was calling around. we had a really good conversation and I felt like I clicked with her to be comfortable so I definitely wanted to come back and even recommend her. I still get my service done and she did an ok job. We still talked away a storm of conversation but I didn't forget what happened. I was just trying not to let it get to me because I am nice person and I didn't feel like causing a scene and I am a better person to step down to that level.

Can't be wrong, I am a weird person, but being unaware or being unprofessional at your work, no matter what you think of someone I'd be careful with what you have to say and keep opinions outside of the work area. I would point out the name of this stylist, but I choose not to because the salon itself is just terrible with communication and it's service so this review is not just for her, but for everyone. I just don't get when you have several ladies ask you if you need any help and then later they tell the other ladies that someone didn't show up when the person is waiting and then gets called by the stylist you are seeing that you're a weird one and basically saying that you're not liked and they don't even know you're around. 

I will never be getting service from this salon again even to ask for advice",2019,FL,Florida,39.4795684,-119.7940801,Y,2
akLg34K_gsXLQuqpUutGJg,qPohxPukFHiTsQ5wFQa0FQ,1.0,"I went to my appointment and told her I needed my brown roots to be blonde like the rest of my hair. The only thing I needed was to not have it go all the way down to my scalp because I can't afford to come back every few weeks to get it touched up and I didn't want it to grow out with a blunt line between the blonde and my roots (and the last time I went all the way to the scalp the chick burned my head). Then a toner to get it all looking cohesive. 
So, all over blonde on my roots but instead of going all the way to the scalp, just use the brush to feather it in so when it grows out a little it won't look too bad. Sounds simple enough. Except Cici was extremely confused. She kept saying she could do highlights but that isn't what I wanted. Then she said she was going to get the manager so I waited for her to finish her other appointment. While we were waiting, she said that she didn't feel confident enough to be able to do my hair and maybe someone else should do it. So that wasn't comforting at all. 
Then the manager came over and told me that what I was asking for was difficult and kept suggesting highlights and partial highlights and a balayage. They wouldn't listen when I kept trying to say I didn't want those things. I just wanted all the roots to be blonde but apparently they can't do that.

After weeks of trying to allow them to make it right they concluded that I am not important enough of a customer to do anything for me. The salon in Ulta destroyed my hair. I did not pay for the services. They offered me a free salon service to make things right... like I would EVER trust them with my hair again. HA! Then they offered me a thoughtless gift of things ""they give away for free anyway"", things I would NEVER use. Things you would give to somebody who goes clubbing on the weekends or likes to wear heavy night makeup (which is completely beautiful and fine but I am a mother of two who rarely gets out and I only need my essentials) they refused to issue me a giftcard for the amount of the gifts they offered. (probably because they wanted to skate by on giving me free stuff they hand out to customers and employees as gifts anyway) this MULTI BILLION dollar company couldn't afford to give me a gift card to use IN THEIR STORE to make amends on what they did to my hair, how much money I had to spend elsewhere to get it fixed... HUNDREDS of dollars in services and products to reverse the damage done by the bleach this man applied THREE TIMES in one sitting, a service that took FIVE HOURS of my time. MY time that I had to pay a babysitter for. MY time that I never ever get to myself because I am a full time student, have a full time job, have a family.

Maybe you guys can't afford to make up for all your mistakes because maybe there are more frequent than you'd like to admit, maybe you would go bankrupt if you made things right for everybody you disappointed. Maybe THATS why your company told me that I should be grateful for what you offered me, even if it was things I would never use, and to ""take it or leave it because I was being ungrateful"" Thank you for disrespecting me so much.

Ok, awesome because that's what I was here to look at, and I get a gift on top of it if I buy from here, I am pretty much sold as a customer here. So I end up getting the liters of shampoo and conditioner and bringing to the front by the register. There's only one person working the register, and it's seriously taking her 5-10 minutes per customer. I understand trying to relate to the customer by saying oh I love blah blah, but seriously when customers have to wait in line 30 minutes while you BS and make small talk is ridiculous. There was another woman that was just walking around, I am not sure what the heck she is doing, but she keeps walking to register then walking off again, so she can clearly see the line of people waiting. So 30 minutes of waiting I am finally up to the register, she signs me up for their rewards program, ok not sure what the rewards even are. At least at Sephora I can clearly see at the register what I can get with points, here I have no clue. So finally get checked out and on my way. Down the street when I getting gas, I think wait a minute I didn't get the gift that they have advertised all over their store. So I drive back, of course there is a line where I wait 10 minutes, while they try to find more products around the store for the person at the register. What the heck!?? Why don't you have this lady go to the side, have someone who isn't working the register go help her find what she needs. Finally, she notices that I'm back and looks confused, I point to the sign and say wasn't I suppose to get a gift? She looks confused and said, ""oh what are you pointing at?"" Ummm... the sign that is plastered all over this place (I didn't say this). Then she says, ""Oh yea, I tried to see if we had any when you bought it, but didn't see any, so that's why I didn't give it to you."" Ok, this makes it even worse, so you knew that my purchase should have included the gift and instead of saying, ""I am sorry we are out,"" or making the excuse, ""We just ran out."" You decide to hope I won't notice, which back fires because I now go out of my way to drive all the way back here, stand in line again, and listen how you didn't really care about me as a customer. She obviously could tell I am annoyed then starts looking through their cupboards that are disheveled and finds this crappy looking bag that says Pureology on it and some other lame saying on it, that no one in their sane mind would ever use unless you were a hairdresser.

One of Ulta's main draws is their complete selection of drug store brand cosmetics (L'Oreal, Maybelline, Revlon). Also, the availability of the NYX line - which now can be found in Target, amazingly.  I've got to be honest - I've found NYX products to be crap.  But they do have a large variety of products, many of which I'd affiliate with higher-up brand make-up (primers, glittery eye liner, chubby stick eye pencils).  

I've been steered well by the same employee multiple times, as to which products to buy and which to avoid.  She'll tell me honestly which are not worth purchasing!  Very thankful for that.

It seems Ulta now offers some high end brands these days, such as Lorac, Stila, Two Faced. I sort of think it's their way of competing with Sephora, which I consider to be the department store makeup SUPER STORE.  I shop at them both.

This place recently opened and I had to see what my friends were raving about.

Wow. Just about everything health and beauty related can be had in one location.

Off the top of my head, they have: makeup and accessories, nail polish/gel (and lamps), hair brushes/combs, stuff for your brows, bleaching, hair removers, nail clippers, hair dryers, shampoos, conditioners, other hair products, lipstick, etc. Basically, almost anything you can find in a drugstore or average beauty salon can be found here. And more.

They have Ulta brands (there were a few $2/$4 sales going on when I was in) and Sally Hansen and many major brands. 

Because I think certain companies want all of their products in their own dedicated aisle, you may have to search around for items such as lipsticks and nail polish, whether they are all in the same aisle, or in their own major brand aisle.

I think (but I'm not sure) that they even had beauty consultants to help you choose makeup by applying them on you.

If you're into someone greeting you, they definitely have this one attentive woman who made a point of greeting everyone that comes in.

Note: I don't usually buy high-end products, so I don't know if those are carried here. And if you're loyal to certain brands at department stores, they may not have them here. This really is a one-stop place for your day-to-day beauty needs.",2013,FL,Florida,36.1096395843,-86.7648176939,Y,9

She's a stylist you can trust not to go crazy cutting off all your long hair, which I appreciate. 

She did a wonderful job with my color, and was a relaxing and interesting person to talk to. I'm so glad they opened this salon; we needed something in this area. 

The variety of high-end cosmetics next to drugstore cosmetics is so convenient. I tried their waterproof Ulta brand mascara, and mascara sealer (both $4), and they worked amazing! Idk if they're cruelty-free, though. :/ I'm switching to all CF, so I should've checked. 

Ulta has a ton of fragrances, a lot of the newest hairstyling appliances, and some of the most beautiful hair accessories (barrettes and headbands)  I've seen in ages.

I checked Pricey, because the prices can go from Moderate to $18 for a bottle of nail polish. Also be sure to ask before you have a hair service what the price will be. My hair was $80, not the $55 listed on the menu. That's okay, but be aware to ask, it may be more depending on what you get, like mine was.

KZV8cpBu4Ax1bZMucV3_Ww,IV6NVFYNeFEcWp8TEn5cwQ,2.0,"Well, here I go :(

I knew better but it shouldn't be this way. I need a forever hair stylist that doesn't want my soul to make my hair look good. I called in good faith and asked for a color specialist (they all say they are and that it's their favorite part of styling :-/ )... anyhow, Emily assured me that their newest stylist (Katie) was a color correction specialist and she wasn't new to de industry, well 3 years isn't what I call specialist level specially because I'm pregnant and she obviously used the wrong volume to do the processing of my hair and left patches everywhere. She still uses the board and she dropped it a few too many times on the floor that I felt bad for all of them. It's funny how I was joking with her that I hated 2000's chunks of hair that was called highlights just to make sure she used a fine technique when grabbing my highlights, wishful thinking. My appointment was at 1 but I was running 15 mins late but it didn't matter because I had to wait for my stylist to be done with her previous appointment for another 30 mins (that's 45 mins I would of have to wait if I wouldn't have been late). I told her time was an issue but I wasn't done until 5:30 and unhappy. I told her I was for sure calling back. Color was super ashy with the outside light and she chopped my hair off, not really a real hair cut where she would of have noticed the shorter side on it. Nice girl but need to really practice and listen to her clients and if she can't deliver is best to say so. No shame on that, trust me. 

Mistake #2... going back to ""fix"" it. 7 years and I don't know why she did what she did... ""Your hair looked better with the 1st mistake"" ( my husband's words and he is the one that tells me I look amazing even if I'm wearing a trash bag) so yeah. Amber removed the toner Katie put on, barley blended the patchy places and threw another toner that gave me a color if Katy Griffin's hair had a baby with a M&M. She also ""fixed"" the cut by using some special technique. Well tell that to the ponytail lol (see pic. Lol).

I will say they were very polite and willing to try to fix the mistake and never changed their attitude to an ugly unpleasant experience. 

Oh well at least my husband got a kick at the Pinterest vs. reality moment of my life until I told him I paid $220, not so funny then... Save your money girls. Go to the schools to get this quality, seriously.

I had my share of bad hair business and it seems it will continue but the best has yet to be on ""professional salons"" with the most experienced stylist :)... I can't even.",2021,FL,Florida,36.1096395843,-86.7648176939,Y,4

However, I'm always open to a second opinion from staff, since I assume they are passionate about makeup to be working there (won't make that mistake again). I shade matched myself with a product I'm extremely familiar with, the It Cosmetics CC Cream. I have recently started using tanning lotion so I needed a shade or 2 darker than my usual Fair Light, and yes I knew the nature of product's oxidation. As I was reaching for my new shade one of the staff asked me if I needed any help shade matching. Since I was wearing a mask for Covid regulations and couldn't sample the product on my skin (had to rely on bottle color), I said ""sure, I wouldn't mind a second opinion."" I was then swarmed by 2 other staff members when the first couldn't decide which shade of the 2 I brought to her was best, and then one of the 3 staff members asked me if I wanted a foundation. I said no, I wanted a CC cream. She then responded to me in an extremely bitchy tone, ""what do you mean by CC cream??"" as if I'm the one with the crazy ideas. Anyone who has even an inkling of the scope of the makeup world knows that CC's creams have become very popular in recent years because of the quality of their coverage combined with skincare ingredients and SPF. Just because Ulta staff isn't aware of them doesn't mean they aren't prevalent - big brands like Maybelline, Neutrogena, NYX, e.l.f., etc. all have their own versions that are named, you guessed it, ""CC Creams."" It's not MY problem the staff here isn't up to date on trends that are already years old. All 3 staffers then proceeded to tell me neither shade I chose would work, they were both too dark. Well, the next shade up was the one I already owned that was now too light, aka the whole reason I'm in there! I politely said ""guess I must be a shade in between, thanks anyway for your help."" Silence. Not only does the staff seem to have no concept of the makeup world, they don't even know how to make a sale. I was basically left with no other product options and left the store. Jokes on them - not one person in the staff was even aware that Ulta carries CC creams from DOZENS of other brands that one of them could have showed me and I would be open to buying. Instead I was met with terrible attitudes and made to feel like a fool at something I'm actually really good at. Makeup is very important to me, I consider it an art and I enjoy every experience I get with it, including the buying experience. Thank god the Green Hills mall just opened a much nicer Ulta - the 100 Oaks location just lost a long time customer.",2021,FL,Florida,36.1096395843,-86.7648176939,Y,1

She had no problem stopping what she was doing walking me over to the product that she thought was going to work and actually putting it on my face right there in the store in the aisle so I could see in the mirror. It worked wonders, and also is not an expensive brand. In addition, I inquired about setting powder and mascara. Again, she took me to where the product she told me work best for her and she had tried them all and they were good products, not high-end brands. Her name was Melissa, I think she was a manager. She personally went and checked me out herself with my coupon discount that of course did not have with me, but found on-line

They have a salon, which I have not taken advantage of yet, but plan to. And they also have a full calendar of beauty/makeup events that go on throughout the month (calendar should be right when you walk in). 

Some of my favorite things to pick up here are Batiste dry shampoo, Urban Decay products, shampoo & conditioner, The Body Shop butters and oils, hair dye, and NYX products (LOVE their matte lipstick).

I hadn't been to an Ulta in some time, and I think I'm good for a while.  I walked into a very busy store, which is completely understandable.  I was looking for a contour kit, a concealer, and possibly a brow kit.  I may as well have been looking for a unicorn, a leprechaun, and a pot of gold.  I was desperately trying to find a contour kit and could not.  I looked everywhere, then finally got someone's attention.  She said they have one but the contour color was the same color as my skin (I am black but probably somewhere in between the shades of Beyonce and Oprah- in Maybelline, that is Light Cocoa).  When I saw the color she was referencing, I was astonished and mildly offended due to the fact that my skin color is SO far off.  I could absolutely contour with that color.  I picked up the kit, but then I was so thrown off, I didn't even want it anymore.  I did end up spending a pretty penny in there, but I wasn't in love with this person, who seems to be someone of some type of importance since she was literally speaking into her little earpiece the ENTIRE time I was there.

What I like the most is that they sell hair products that you mostly only find online and almost every line of cosmetic (no MAC). Additionally they have their own cheaper brand products. I have used their hair salon and I think is ok for the basics (blow dry, trim and wash) but wouldn't be my first choice for specialized hair services.

It was my first time ever getting my hair done in Ulta and I have to say I was really impressed. The salon is in the back of the store and at first I thought it would be strange getting my hair done in a store where anyone could walk by but it really does feel quiet and secluded.  The store has so much stuff! I really wanted to spend more time playing with the makeup and creams but I was short on time. I had to do a couple of double takes when I saw the brands I usually have to go to Sephora for. I don't know why but I always thought they just had grocery store brands at Ulta. The store was really clean and organized and there seemed to have a lot of people walking around doing demonstrations. 

Veronica asked me a lot of questions since I wasn't sure what I wanted a far as color went. She offered several suggestions and showed me what the color would like next to my skin. Honestly, I was in such bad shape she could have just dyed my hair black and it would have been better than what I had. I knew exactly what I wanted for the cut and Veronica said she understood exactly what I wa looking for. Her prices seemed to be right around what I was paying across the street at the mall so I wasn't stressed about that but I really appreciate her telling me up front. Veronica also told me that if I had an Ulta loyalty card I would earn points for all my services. BONUS!!! Can't get that at the mall. 

While my hair was processing I sat in a separate room where the shampoo bowls are. I saw that they a nail station. One of the other stylists told me they just do gel polish and that she had some time if I wanted to freshen up my nails. I desperately needed them done so I said yes please to that. That stylist, Carly, was really sweet as well and did a great job and she saved me a trip later in the week!

Veronica came back, shampooed me out and then took me back to her chair to do my cut. Veronica started talking about skin care and that they offer facials and waxing, that she only does hair but she could introduce me to those people before I left.  The next  thing I know I was done. I totally did not even recognize my self in the mirror. I had all this volume and body. I thought maybe she had used a curling iron or something, but nope just a leave in conditioner and a round brush. I rescheduled for my color next month because I guess she gets booked up really fast. I didn't have time to talk to the skin care person but I am really thinking I need that in my life.

I had no idea they had so much to offer! I definitely recommend Veronica! I will definitely be back next month to rack up even more points.",2016,LA,Luisiana,27.9417732,-82.3217625,Y,4

I stopped into the Brandon Ulta to browse and pick up some new products. I'm not a huge make up person-so it does take me a bit longer to look at products and determine what I need. 

I was looking at some on sale UD lipsticks. An associate asked if I needed help, and I asked if they had a shade that was missing. They were out. No big deal. I kept looking and comparing shades. The associate kept hanging around me. It was getting awkward. Here's the kicker-

I heard her, only inches next to me say on her intercom ""hold on, I need to watch her"". She then proceeded to stand there and stare at me. I regret not saying anything. I should have. I don't steal, and this was insulting and uncomfortable.

I kept shopping, but moved to the other side of the store. I went there with a purpose, and it was a long drive to turn around and leave. I however, won't be back.

I went in Feb 2014 for a haircut with Sara Dame a hair stylist at Ulta Salon Brandon. I came in with pictures and a very clear idea of what I wanted, which was the haircut Jessica Alba got around the same time, medium length hair in the back and longer in the front. Totally even all around except for obviously the front. What I came out with was extremely short hair that reached the nape of my neck and got progressively longer with the hair at the front reaching just above my collar bone. AKA a bob. Not what I wanted at all, nor resembled the pictures I had shown. Before she cut my hair we discussed how short I wanted it and I honestly thought she was going to stick to that. When I said it was so short she justified that I could still put it into a pony tail... a very low pony tail. She turned me away from the mirror during the whole process so I could not see what she was doing and cut. Then she gave me the absolute worse blow out ever given which she offered to fix with the straightener for extra charge! I was left with puffy, frizzy hair and she twisted up pieces and cut again. My hair was and still is uneven in places. The left side of my hair is longer than the right, it looks choppy and looks like it was cut off with a blade. NO two pieces of my hair are the same length!! Six months later and my hair still looks horrible but is more manageable when curled or waved.. straight hair is a disaster. Do not cut your hair here, idk about the other stylist but I would not after that nightmare. Last time I have ever stepped foot at Ulta.",2014,LA,Luisiana,27.9417732,-82.3217625,Y,8

We were in early and as other stylists walked in she was loudly describing how they had each been on a wild girls trip and how much fun they had.  Not everyone was as excited as her but I thought that's great - she had fun.  Except she never really stopped talking to everyone.

swK7WAxE1tGhMeVfwCySzQ,LAfBjmgtmIE0FqedMIyy1A,1.0,"DO NOT GO TO THE HAIR SALON HERE!!!!!
This Ulta has been going downhill for a while. It's always messy and unorganized, there's bins left on the floor in the aisles, the employees on the floor are rude and will point out flaws in your makeup, it's not clean or well kept, the employees seem miserable, and they're always out of stock of popular items. Me and my mom had a terrible experience at the hair salon in particular.
Last year we went to get our hair done here because we've always liked buying makeup at Ulta and figured we would have a good experience. I wanted ombré with platinum ends. My hair was chocolate brown. My hairdresser explained to me she wouldn't be able to get my ends all the way to platinum in one sitting and that I'd have to come back probably one more time. I didn't know anything about bleaching hair at the time but I was okay with it and wanted her to do what she could to get it as blonde as possible. My senior pictures were the next day so I still wanted it to look nice. She asked me if I wanted a solid ombré or this choppy style ombré she had done on other clients. I specifically said solid ombré and had a reference picture. I ended up with an orangey gold, unblended, I don't even know what to call it. I think she tried to do the choppy style ombré with streaks that she had done on other clients when I specifically asked for solid ombré. It looked terrible. There was a line between the brown and the orangey gold. There were parts that were so patchy they looked like hot topic patterned hair extensions. I even showed my hairdresser as she was leaving and she acted like she didn't see anything. My mom's hairdresser saw how bad of a job mine did and ended up blending some parts more with toner for me because my hairdresser left. I don't know what my hairdresser used on my hair but it didn't look good at all. I've seen good hairdressers take brown hair to platinum in one sitting. A few years back I had the same thing done at Fantastic Sam's in Sun City and they got my ends to platinum without major damage, and the ombré was nicely blended. It was much cheaper than Ulta, which ended up being about $200 each for me and my mom. My hairdresser at Ulta could have at least blended it nicely and toned it right.
My mom had a bad experience too. She wanted a balayage and had dark brown, almost black hair. Her hairdresser claimed to be the best colorist at the salon. She ended up taking forever on my mom because she had to strip the box color first, then work on the balayage. She took on another client about halfway through and worked on them both at the same time, which was a problem. She was rushing on my mom's hair and we didn't end up leaving until after 9:00 at night (started around 4:00). She wouldn't even style her hair at the end! My mom had to style it herself and this other hairstylist gave her an attitude when she asked for some hairspray. My mom ended up with red and orange streaks on the back of her head. Needless to say, when we walked out of there we were not happy.
We talked to the manager about the situation afterwards and she wouldn't refund us; instead she offered to ""fix"" our hair for free on another day. When she did my hair she was really nice and apologetic about it, but I don't think she even did anything but tone my hair because it looked the same, just gray, and the ombré wasn't fixed.

There are many other good deals which is why this store is very popular. 

Unfortunately, I don't go very often because it's so difficult to get in and out of Regency Square because of the traffic situation.

Usually if a place can get me in even if I have to wait for a bit I will stay and usually means I will buy more because I'm waiting but it was chaos and off putting I'm sorry but if you need your brows done your not waiting a week for an appointment that's absurd.

Second Appointment: I decided i wanted to color my hair and get some highlights along with a minor color correction. The full color is fine but the highlights are thick like Britney Spears from he early 2000's and are warm toned when I obviously have cool toned skin. The picture I showed her is very subtle, cool toned highlights which she said she could do. I paid $200 for this and am very unhappy with the result.

From the time I walked in, I did not feel welcome, got some pretty hostile stares from staff. I found an eyeliner I liked but had some issues with the lipgloss..I guess brown isn't popular nowadays. Well I basically walked through the entire store swatching things on my own and after 30 minutes someone asked if I need help...I say yes...and she points me in the direction of a gold gloss (I don't want gold) then a pink gloss (also not quite what I want) but then all of a sudden she dashes off to help someone else...ummm. Ok. Bye I guess. I felt very unvalued. 

I mentioned I was swatching before on my own. Turns out this is quite difficult because the stations are poorly stocked with makeup remover and alcohol and each station is completely different and random. One had a spray bottle of alcohol, brush cleaner and hand sanitizer. Another had a jumbo hand sanitizer bottle and another had a spray bottle of water (not sure when I would use water alone but hey). Was also difficult to find trash cans around the store to throw away the applicators used for testing.

This is why I know that there was no excuse for the way I was treated yesterday at this Ulta location. I went in because I needed new foundation. So I went to go pick it out and the specific color I needed, was not on the floor. (This happens frequently at these stores, all you have to do is ask someone if they have any somewhere else or in the back) So I looked around to see if I could find anything within the same brand that was similar because I had my 6 month old infant and mother with me and I didn't want to hunt someone down to ask. But finally I gave in and I decided that I needed help. There was a girl working in front of the MAC products. So my mother kindly asked if she could see if there was anything she could do to help, and the girl responded by very rudely by saying that what's on the floor is all we have. And then she turned her back to us, and completely blew us off. I mean we didn't get a smile, a nod, she was straight faced and looked annoyed with us. And she wasn't assisting anyone else, so it's not like we were interrupting. I was actually shocked. I started looking around again and I probably looked pretty thrown off by what just happened. Then, a different woman walked over to assist me and asked if I needed help. I told her a little bit of what happened and she looked slightly Confused and said ""well maybe she was
Misinformed."" I actually thought it was nice of her to cover for her coworker. She then proceeded to go in the back and then she came back with exactly what I needed. The girl working in front of the MAC products just didn't want to take any time helping I guess. But to the lovely lady who helped, thank you!

BUT the Ulta's near me have been notorious for being sneaky and not giving you the sale that they promote when your products are ringed up. My best friend used to go here a lot with me years ago. For example, if she would get a products that was ""Buy 1 get 1 free"" she would be charged for both items at ringup. She would either have to correct them at the register, or wouldn't notice until she got home. When I went last week, I decided the $55 hair curler and $30 eyebrow kit I got wasn't what expected, I returned it. I noticed at the register when she was doing the return that the curler scanned at $47 back to me. I told her it was more than $47 when I purchased it last week and she said, ""oh, its on sale right now"" but then turned to her manager next to her and asked to make sure that I just get the sale price back. Luckily her manager corrected her and said, ""no, she gets the full price back if thats what she paid, sale or not right now.""

I don't know if Ulta just prefers girls who don't know what they're doing, or maybe someone at these locations isn't registering all the sales into their computer prior to advertising the sales. Another thing is that the customer service and help is almost non-existent. An associate applying makeup to a customers face was approached by another woman who asked for help in finding a product. The associate said she would help her after she was  done doing the makeup for this other woman, but when the customer asked a different question nicely, the associate rudely said, ""I said I'll help when I'm done here"" Very rude and very unprofessional. There also was no one else to help this woman. I don't know if Ulta is understaffed or that their associates jsut like to crowd in a corner and chat for $8 an hour.

Thank you ladies!",2015,PA,Pensilvania,40.158455,-75.143143,Y,2

This haircut is what makes me so mad BC it is shorter than we agreed to. And it is completely lopsided and not in a modern way. When I tried to tell her after the three hours I was so frustrated she needed that long in the first place that I said something quietly and she couldn't even see what I was talking about. This is the worst haircut I have ever received I really did not want to pay but I did anyway.

I went back to the salon the next morning and Tanya the manager was a lifesaver. She did a great job at correcting my color and cut which is all I wanted. I would return for her. Great job Ulta!",2015,PA,Pensilvania,40.158455,-75.143143,Y,2

I politely spoke up resaying all I wanted was a simple trim and long layers if possible not chunky layers. Well chunky uneven layers is what I got!!! She turned the chair for drying and insisted on curling my hair which I said wasn't necessary but allowed her to anyway.

My appointment was for 12:15pm. By the time we got started, it was 12:25pm. My esthetician's name was Aaryn. She confirmed I was getting a 60 minute service. I was asked to fill out a form regarding my overall health and skin type. Aaryn made small talk in the beginning and discussed my top 3 skin concerns with me. She descended the chair to the lowest position, told me to get comfortable and put a blanket over top of me. It was cozy. 

What I didn't like about this experience was that Aaryn didn't go over ANY of the products she used on my face. She could've put anything on my face and I wouldn't know because nothing was said. 
Another pet peeve was the fact that she kept getting up and walking away. She'd leave me in the chair with the product on my face and go elsewhere. She turned on a machine that released steam and I felt the heat and steam mist onto my cheeks. 

When she was done the facial, it was 12:59pm. Definitely not 60 minutes... I felt like I got ripped off because she was in a rush to finish the service. One of my concerns was redness in my cheeks. She handed me a mirror to show me the finished look and I felt like I had more redness than I did when I first got there. I asked her about a cool tingling sensation in my face and she explained that it was an exfoliating product she used that could be causing the feeling. 

Went up to the cashier to pay and Aaryn was nowhere to be found. She didn't go over any aftercare with me and I had to leave her tip in an envelope with another employee. It was kind of unprofessional.

After calling both locations and verifying the reps on the phone told me BOTH products were available I decided to drive to this location since it's closer to my house. Unfortunately when I get there, my Too Faced concealer shade was not available - this is after waiting for 20 minutes to see if someone could locate it in the back since it wasn't on the floor. After receiving this news, I was clearly annoyed since the whole reason for me to go to that store was because they told me it was in stock. The rep who told me it wasn't available was practically laughing in my face - maybe it was a nervous tick but this just agitated me more. She did try to help me find matches in other brands but apparently Ulta doesn't release samples? This is very bizarre to me and I never heard this but I was basically out of luck with this. The rep I was working with then pulled her manager over and she just made excuses for whoever answered my call ie maybe they got it confused with the foundation - even though I specially requested the concealer on the phone, or maybe stock numbers are not correct because of theft issues the store had.

3iG0b50pTbP-BODjz12HOw,HIE4JTORkwfuc_XO2nRVAQ,2.0,"I used to get my hair cut at Beauty Brands with Angelica, and I LOVED how my hair came out every time. But the Beauty Brands store recently shut down. There is an Ulta by my work, so I made a hair appointment at the Salon with Jessica? I think her name was. She was very friendly, had great customer service, finished the hair wash, cut, and style quickly. I didn't do a NEW hair style at all, just asked for a couple inches trimmed off so I can be at the shorter length that I like. At the end of the appointment she offered to curl my hair to make it look beachy, which I thought nothing of at the time. It felt a little shorter than I desired, but I thought- it's hair and it will grow back, not the end of the world. But the next day when I straightened my hair, I noticed that it looked really choppy. I thought maybe she parted it different when she cut it, but no matter where I part my hair it looks so bad! It's embarrassing! I have to wear my hair tucked behind my ear until it finally grows out. Needless to say I will be cancelling my next hair appointment that I made with her in April, and will be going elsewhere. Seriously not worth the $50 that I spent on that hair cut, I could've got this hair cut at a great clips somewhere for $10.... I know $50 isn't that expensive, but I would expect to be a lot happier... 

On the up side, I also got my brows waxed at the brow bar by Angelique. She did an amazing job!! And I will be returning to see her for another brow wax soon!

My mom and I picked out some great items with the help of a couple ladies working.. Yes, we needed to get their attention, but neither copped any kind of attitude when we asked for assistance.

dkvRoZ646VM9fwqARUcHgg,HIE4JTORkwfuc_XO2nRVAQ,2.0,"I went in for what was supposed to be a 10 minute appointment, but it ended up lasting over an hour. I love ulta for the products they carry--especially since they have both drugstore and high end options--as well as for the membership offers they have in addition to their frequent sales. I'm a platinum member and ulta credit card holder. I spend my money here frequently; in fact, I probably spend too much of my money here. And this most recent experience has me reevaluating  whether I should make sephora my primary make up store, instead of ulta. 

Even before today's experience I have always found the customer service experience at ulta lacking. Today was no different. I had an appointment at 2:15 for a 10 minute face fit facial. I had never been to the salon at ulta before and I only made this appointment because I had a coupon. 

I checked in at the salon desk and was greeted quickly, told that my facialist would be ready soon, and was provided with a bottle of water. So far so good. But when 5 minutes go by, I am getting impatient. I return to the desk and am told that she might still be with her previous client; there's no confirmation though and no employee seems concerned enough to double check;
There's also no apology. 10 minutes later, she finally finishes with that client at 2:30 and my face fit treatment starts at 2:35-20 minutes late. The face fit treatment itself was truly wonderful and She gave me many helpful pointers and insiders. I would rate that experience highly; however, it's the ancillary issues that are really aggravating. 

I not only had to wait longer for my appointment than it lasted, but then I also had to wait more just to check out. My facialist gave me my bill and told me that I needed to pay at the front. So that's what I did. Well 20 minutes later and I was still not checked out. I don't know what the deal is but every time I go to ulta the line is horrendously long because they only have one cashier, who is operating at a slow pace. This in addition to the coupon I had really got everybody mixed up and confused--because no one knew how to redeem the coupon--and it took forever to finally pay. It was ridiculous. It shouldn't be this complicated to use a coupon for your store. I was also told that I was supposed to pay at the salon desk; what the heck?! I don't work here--I'm just trying to be a patron but they made it really hard.

I came in today to purchase a bottle of foundation that I've been using for a while, though it may be time to do a color match again since I've tanned a bit this summer. I mention this because the last time I was in this store, I asked for help with a color match and got an eye roll; after about 15 minutes waiting with no one actually coming to help me I left that time. I mention this because I am not the prettiest woman for sure, and I don't wear a whole lot of makeup so I have felt intimidated and sometimes unwelcome by the staff. 

Today was different in that a very nice (and intimidatingly pretty) woman came up to me as she saw me searching the shelf and asked if I needed help. I mentioned my issue of not being able to find my foundation shade on my previous two visits, and she was beyond helpful- she looked, and when she also didn't find it, she offered to have it ordered and shipped to my house, and went further to offer to grab me a sample of the foundation so I would have some in the time it took to arrive.

ix4vKMvdJSUIwXYZ7yaLuA,HIE4JTORkwfuc_XO2nRVAQ,3.0,"Usually when I go into Ulta, I am very satisfied as I am a die hard rewards member, avid bargain hunter and like to occasionally splurge on a high-end beauty product or two. The past few times I have gone in I have noticed some things that affect my rating.

1) The Benefit Bar: This is a wonderful idea and selling tactic for the brand but at this local, it looks unkempt. The products (testers) look as if they have been out too long and not sanitized (I wouldn't DARE even swatch them). The artists who are Benefit trained to do waxing, etc, don't seem to keep a very good schedule as I have seen lines of people waiting  for their appointments on numerous occasions. I have also seen these employee's neglecting customers as they chat and test out products themselves. I like some of Benefit's products, but this turns me off from trying anything else.
2) A few of the newer associates at the register are not too personable. There is no connection between associate and customer when I've come up to purchase. No general ""How was your visit?"" or ""Did you find what you were looking for?"" from many of the ladies.
I understand that people have bad days, but some seem to have a bad day, every day.
3) I feel as though some of the associates do not know their stock. I have come in asking for specific products and have received blank stares. I have considered applying to work for Ulta as I love Makeup and it's a huge part of my job as a performer. It is amazing to me that those who are already employed are not up to date on latest trends or current releases. 

I will still shop at this Ulta because of it being so close and because of the rewards program (it's a lot better than Sephora), but I feel that some changes do need to be made.",2014,LA,Luisiana,32.2848363689,-110.97488218,Y,1

After driving 45 min, I get to the location and call in my order for pickup, but the manager Mary says the order won't be ready until the next day. I received no email regarding a time it would be ready, but just the confirmation number and location hours. Manager Mary didn't give us any compensation or sincere help but instead just exclaims, ""that's the way the system is"". Bottom line, ALL EMPLOYEES SHOULD TELL CUSTOMERS THIS because people are driving for items that cannot be given to them.

aHiQYaTXrmQTeG6106l5wg,HIE4JTORkwfuc_XO2nRVAQ,4.0,Today I can say I am a fan.  Usually when I go into an Ulta store no one really comes up to you and helps with any sort of enthusiasm but today was different.  I was in the market for a lipstick.  I knew what type of shade I was looking for.  Two lovely young ladies were both just rushing around the different counters looking for lipsticks for me and taking the proper precautions in setting the lipsticks so I could try them on.Wiping them down and sanitizing as needed.   I only asked one of the ladies her name.  She was Maria Martin and worked specifically at the Calvin Klein section.  She and the other young lady both were actively helping me.  Maria had a great sense of humor and even put some extra make-up on me.  I was a bit disappointed because my $3.50 didn't apply to the lines of lipstick I was looking for.  So much for any bargain.  I know you always have the read between the lines on these Sunday coupons.  I was happy today with the service I got today.,2013,LA,Luisiana,32.2848363689,-110.97488218,Y,8
ULY4ARQAP1kBe7ItlggyHg,HIE4JTORkwfuc_XO2nRVAQ,1.0,"Went to this location with my bonus mom to find a shade of L'Oréal eyeshadow she was running out of. She had previously learned the color was discontinued, so wanted a similar color to replace it. 

A young woman asked if we needed help. My mom explained what she was looking for and we followed her to the L'Oréal area. She looked through the eyeshadows and eventually found two similar colors, one was considerably darker and the other had more red in it. Nevertheless my mom found one of them acceptable when applied to her arm, so settled on the color. The young employee searched through the bin for some time and did not find the color in stock. She said perhaps it could be shipped to home, then spoke briefly to a co-worker. When she returned she said there is a new way the ship to door (or whatever the method is called) is handled and that we'd need to go through the line and the person at the register would determine if the eyeshadow is available to ship. Immediately I wondered, why must we go through a line potentially to be told this eyeshadow is unavailable?!  Shouldn't one of the numerous workers here helping no one be able to tell us if this is available without standing in line??  Who makes you wait in a line for the opportunity to learn if you can get a product by mail?  Possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard but my mom wasn't bothered by it and we got in line. Thankfully it wasn't long but once we got to the cashier she also had to confer with a co-worker or two for several minutes to determine the eyeshadow we wanted to buy was not available. Soooo, why on earth is there a product on the shelf that is not available in store or by mail?  I suggested they should remove it from the shelf if it isn't available. A co-worker pushed back that it should remain there as it could become available later. 

So now we've waited in line for nothing and, mind you, not one of the four or five employees involved ever thought to show my mom a similar color in another brand. Not one!!! Instead they let us walk out without making a sale! Incredulous.",2021,LA,Luisiana,32.2848363689,-110.97488218,Y,11

aa7nCvoM_4Qjvry5Kj11_g,iwSHtwr96TyhhnclQZHGEg,1.0,"I arrived 15 minutes early for a haircut w/ style and all over highlights. This was my 1st trip to Ultabeauty and I was excited. I only have my hair done every 6 months since it's so expensive. I arrived with naturally curly hair that reached my bra strap in the back. 
 I was left alone several times
( more than 3) for my stylist to answer the salon phone and once for an extended personal call. It was like i had arrived at Great Clips or some other walk-in salon. It took over 3 hours and 20 minutes for my services because of this delay, along with 20 minutes for her trying to get the color right with toner. 2 different tries.
 I needed to leave for a movie, but told her not to skimp on my hair because of this. I expressed this twice.
First thing that alarmed me was her saying she was only going to cut 2 inches ( since i told her i wanted to keep it long), but with her contined ""trimming"" which I thought was ""shaping"" ended up to be more like 4 inches once i really put my hands through it. I entered the salon with the length at my bra strap and now it is barely below my shoulders.
 This made me really really sad to say the least. 
It's like she had never been educated that curly hair shrinks when it dries.  (????!!!!)
Her skills contined to shine (sarcasm) ....To start the ""style"" she began blow drying my hair on high power and heat without a diffuser and proceeded just to straighten the front with a round brush, and scrunching the back. Let me tell you. That's not a good look. She asked why I kept putting my fingers through it, and I told her I didn't like it fuzzy. However, she didn't do anything about this, she just jumped into scheduling me again in 3 months. 
I wanted to sit there and demand she do things over, correctly, but at that point and time, I had been there over 3 hours and 20 minutes, and with a movie previously scheduled with my family at 4pm and being in pain sitting there for so long (putting off another back surgery) it just wasn't an option. 
I literally wanted to cry when I got the $210.00 request for payment. 
I got out my debit card to pay at their register, but was told I couldn't pay at the salon, I had to pay up front. Up front was a line of 15 people waiting to check out. 
This was the cherry on top because there was only 2 sales associates working to check these (now 16) people out, while I counted 7 sales associates just lazily walking through the store with a tool belt full of makeup brushes asking through their nose if they could help you.
Too many ridiculous things happening in a row for me to ever return to this joke of a salon. I'm spreading the word so no one I know goes in to pay hundreds of dollars to stylists who act like they've never worked with anything but straight hair, and have all their hair unexpectedly chopped off that they've been working so hard to grow.

The stylist showed me where they were, and I asked for clip-in, and a recommendation for color. (I've been to another place, and they had been able to match me with a solid color--not a blend. They just didn't have the right length.) First I told her my stylist said to get human hair...but she pointed me to a synthetic that can be curled, and didn't really listen when I was trying to say I'd prefer the human hair...which they had. She was showing me a color that was a blend (several different colors...similar to highlights), and I said, ""This one looks like it's different colors-- I'm looking for one solid color, since my hair isn't highlighted."" Her answer? ""Well realistically your hair isn't one color."" My response, ""But my hair doesn't look like that (meaning what she was showing me)....would someone with my hair wear a blend?"" (I mean...I don't know anything about this, so a legitimate question). Her response, ""I was just opening this box to show it to you""...but said with the most RUDE delivery I have ever heard from a sales associate. Then (annoyed) she went on to say, ""Didn't your stylist tell you where to go or what to get?"" (I thought I'd been clear I wanted human hair...a solid color...which they did have...)

I guess at this point to find what I want I needed to see a professional because the products I purchased didn't have the advertised effect.

It is a really big well lit store and probably has anything you are looking for by way of nail polish, makeup, shampoo, beauty products, etc.

But considering that I was the only one in the store when it opened for the day you'd think that I'd have a salesperson walking alongside of me asking if I needed help.

There were 4 salespeople, one manager and 1 Clinique exclusive representative there.
I had to find a salesperson 3 times to direct me to the product I was looking for.  I did ultimately find what I wanted and then I had to find a person to ring me up.

She enhanced my natural brow shape and made my face look more symmetric.

Like Beauty Brands, they have a salon and hair products. They have $3.50 off $10 purchase coupons available online and in mailers. However, they're quite a bit larger than Beauty Brands.

They also offer some brands that are available at stores like Target. I really like this because it saves me a trip to Target.

If you go here and walk away without buying something (or being able to find what you are looking for) then honestly we need to have a talk.

Ulta is the mecca of beauty products.  They sell their own brand, which you can get at a great price or get a steal of a deal when combining their coupon with their advertisements.  You can also find your normal name brand cosmetics here and they almost always have a great deal on them as well.

They have you covered with anything having to do with anything with beauty.  You will save money by shopping here and you will continue to come back.

There is a point system so you can accumulate points for every dollar you spend at the store.  These add up quite nicely.

Be sure to browse their sale aisle, you're sure to find that last something you might need to make your day complete!",2013,PA,Pensilvania,38.50336629,-90.44727323,Y,2

My daughter is strong because of the work we've done for 5 months and can move her head any direction now thank you and chokes alot less now but still has to have a procedure done thank you but she wouldn't know anything about that since what my daughter has is very rare so maybe she should just stick to working at Ulta.

I ended up getting the dimensional which I guess I was wrong with what I thought it would be.  Well blended highlights and lowlights is what I expected with the underneath of my hair being solid.  I have chunks of highlights going down my part....what is this 2002?  Anyway, besides the fact that my hair did not turn out the way I expected it to I paid a lot of money for very subpar service.  She was too busy doing the hair of another Ulta worker and her son while I was sitting there processing for far too long.  Someone else checked me and rinsed me while she played around and spent a lot of time on this other workers sons hair.  After that she was in a rush to get me out.  Barely cut my hair and just blow dryed it but by this point I was done.  I told her I wanted to be surprised when I put on my glasses but the truth is I could see how chunky my highlights were and I was not happy whatsoever.     As for the cut of my hair she basically was like oh lets just make it a little shorter in back and took five minutes on me instead of treating me the way she did the little boy.  You could tell the girl who rinsed my hair knew what was going on and she was very sweet and tried to make up for my stylist short comings.  At this point I just didn't care anymore.  I wanted to get out of there and get home.  Unfortunately I will be going to Sally's today to purchase something in a box to cover up these chunky highlights it's so embarrassing with them at work but I couldn't do it last night.  This was really something I was looking forward to as it was my first Mother's Day gift and having a baby with some special needs and haven't had time for myself whatsoever in-between just being a new mom and taking my daughter to speech therapy, physical therapy, and a chiropractor.  This was a total flop and I will never return. And to make things worse i was over charged.

Unlike other estheticians, Jenna is so friendly, but doesn't try to converse with you during the entire treatment if she picks up that you'd rather be quiet. She lets you know what she's doing as she does it, makes sure you're doing okay, etc. but doesn't bog you down with asking you a million questions about your life and your opinions while you're trying to relax. This is a HUGE plus. She doesn't ignore you, either, by just plopping you in the chair and getting started, as I've heard some estheticians do. Also you get an arm massage during the facial...I'm starting to sigh, literally, right now, just thinking about it.

Alisha always somehow figures out what I want to do with my hair even though I have the explaining ability of a five-year-old. She also lets me know what condition my hair is in. I didn't get my hair cut for what was probably several years and Alisha cleaned it up without any problem. I used to think that if your hair was long, it didn't make any difference if you had it cut regularly; was I ever wrong. My hair looks so much better for Alisha's skill and tips.

The only downside is the fact that during sales a lot of the best brands are excluded.

FOUR HOURS LATER, yep you read that right 4 HOURS LATER (no cut either just color) I left with severely damaged hair that was FRIED at the roots and tips.  To top it all off they even charged me for the train wreck job they did... but they gave me 20% off, woohoo.  It was THE WORST hair experience I have ever had in the past 10 years I've been going to salons.

WYDTGw-UwtyI6KDprthaOA,Z3JrRDH8jtPy2eyH4-Hx8A,2.0,"Hi Ulta Salon, 
I am expressing my disappointment with the Keratin Treatment I underwent in december at the Dale Mabry Branch. 
This was my first visit and perhaps the last visit to an Ulta Salon.
I have done the Keratin treatment thrice before tying it out at your salon.
Hence, very familiar with the process and the after results. My hair being dry and frizzy shows fantastic results post keratin and it lasts for as long as good 4 months. But this time, its as good as I didnt get a keratin done.
My hair is just the same as before. I spent around 200$ (keratin+haircut) and it was for nothing. I can walk in today and show it to you but I know it would not change anything for me. 
While undergoing the treatment I did noticed the difference in the process itself but I thought why not wait for the results and then decide.
Results - neither softer, nor manageable hair. Looks frizzy and dry just as before. Its been a month to the treatment and everyday I look at my hair I feel cheated. 
I walked out of the salon unsure and confused. As days passed I realized what a blunder it was.
Absolute no value for money. I came to you for the keratin thinking that your a brand and could be trusted. I guess not! 
You should be sorry for the kind of service you give people for a $200 bill.
Sorry Ulta, your are just not worth my money.

-First and Last time customer.",2019,MO,Misuri,28.09621669,-82.50410304,Y,1

After being at the salon for 3.5 hours she decided to start the color over. There was no manager there to assist her and I felt like she was just guessing. By the time I left it was 11 pm and the store had been closed for an hour. Woke up the next day and began flat ironing and noticed one side was significantly shorter than the other. I called the salon and talked to Michelle, the rude manager. She told me to come back and she'd ""take a look"". She was cold, made up excuses and did not make me feel like she was ready to fix the mistake her employee made. She said ""they told me you guys were here late last night because you didn't want to leave with your hair the wrong color"". Excuse me? Do you want to walk around with your hair two separate colors? I don't think so. She completely ruined the chances of me giving the stylist another shot. Too much attitude for a manager!!

I wanted to get back to my roots (literally) so I could grow it out and focus on helping my curls opposed to color care. Arlene worked on me between her other clients to ensure I was cared for, and was a very colorful person who had more years of experience than I've been alive and a beautiful mess of curls herself so I felt confident in a potentially terrifying process. She gave me lots of good information, and made me feel cared for. She had me come back the next day as my hair hadn't reacted as planned to fix it, and I felt very cared for in the process. In love with my new brunette locks and love that she took extra care to match to my roots and not disrupt the natural hair that had come in. My retail experience was nice as well, I got help from several staff members who helped me shade match the Urban Decay Brow Blade to my new color so I can look sharp tomorrow for work.

They were so covered with makeup that when I pulled my hands from the drawers my hands were red from lipstick. Now I know that the staff isn't putting makeup all over the drawers (the customers are) but you would think that the staff would reset the areas and keep them presentable. I can tell this staff doesn't care much about appearance because the other makeup displays/area was completely in disarray. While the staff could have been cleaning up/ organizing on this fairly slow Sunday they were chattering in front with one another. No one even bothered to ask the few customers in the store if they needed help or bothered to greet the people.

The workers there are hit and miss as well with their knowledge of products. I was looking for makeup brushes and an employee from that department approached me. I told her I was looking for a foundation blending brush and she looked puzzled. I had a brush in my hand and asked her if it was a good choice. Her reply to me was ""oh yeah that looks like a foundation brush"".... I then asked her if she could recommend a brush for me and she said all of the foundation brushes were good. I've also run into the same problem asking about makeup swatches and concealer. 

Over all it's not an awful store. If you're looking for something particular I would call the store first before heading over to make sure they have the product. They will even save it for you at the counter.",2016,FL,Florida,28.24419084,-82.35245045,Y,9

The prices for the products are reasonable when using a coupon or when they are on sale. 

After locating my needed products, I headed to the checkout. They had two registers up and running. The line was up and moving. At the register I handed over my coupon, and she scanned it. The coupon did not work. The cashier read the ""rules"" and said she did not understand why it was not working.

Unfortunately, their first impression was so bad, that I did not stay for my consultation and doubt that I will be returning.

I arrived 5 minutes before my appointment, checked in, and told the person helping me that it was my first time there. The staff member told me that my stylist was ""just finishing up"" and asked if I would like to take a look around the store or have a seat. I said that I would like to be seated, but I had to ask where because she failed to show me where and I couldn't identify the seating area. 

As I waited, I noticed one stylist that seemed to be finishing up. However, when she finished, she asked someone else that was waiting to the chair. I was dismayed that this was not my stylist as all of the other stylists did not seem anywhere close to being finished. By this point, it was 10 minutes past my appointment time and I was finally able to catch the attention of someone. This staff member pointed out who my stylist was and said that she would make sure that my stylist knew I was here. The staff member (not my stylist) came back to report that she is ""just finishing up."" After 5 more minutes, the woman's hair was still so wet, and I was not impressed with how long I had to (and still had to) wait.

I am not sure about you, but ""just finishing up"" means 5 minutes (10 minutes at most). I went back to the front desk and asked the woman to cancel the appointment, the woman asked if I was sure since my stylist was ""just finishing up."" My appointment was supposed to be a 30 minute consultation that would have been half over by this point. I know that my consultation was free, and I would have felt differently if this was not my first time there and I had met my stylist before. However, this was a horrible first impression. I felt that my time was not valued--that I was not valued.

I explained that I wasn't the one who was gonna be receiving the packages and that it's going to a random person. They said there's nothing they can do at that point.

I was double charged. I went into this store to make a purchase that came up to 231.00 with my ""all of $11"" savings it totaled up to 219.00. With this transaction specifically I paid $100 on Apple Pay and the remaining balance I paid in cash. When attempting to make the purchase with my Apple Pay at the first register I was told that there were issues with the Apple Pay so I was sent to another register with the same cashier ( I'm assuming she didn't even know what she was doing due to her constant need for assistance). The transaction went through seamlessly, or so I thought. This all took place September 19, 2021. This morning September 21 I logged onto my chase mobile account to see an additional charge of $100 from Ulta, which doesn't even reflect on my Apple Pay transaction. I call customer service to only be told that I have to wait 7 business days to see if the charge will fall off and if not then they can do a follow up. 

All I have to say to this bs is that I'm highly disappointed. I'm an avid shopper, I have shopped at numerous Ultas all over the state.

What I like is that they have EVERYTHING.  Go to your local drugstore and you're faced with a plethora of the big name/inexpensive brand choices.  Go to other beauty supply stores and you have your pick of high end beauty merchandise.  Here?  You have it all.  This, I love, because my favorite mascara just happens to be one that can be found almost anywhere.  My favorite tinted moisturizer, on the other hand, is a more exclusive brand of organic makeup that can be difficult to find.  I like being able to get both in one place.  It's a one-stop-shop for all your beauty/makeup/hair necessities. 

I'm a big fan of their Ulta brand liquid hand soap (I haven't purchased a scent that hasn't proved to be fabulous).  Around the holidays, they have a wonderful supply of gift ideas that are sure to stuff your stockings full of loveliness.  They carry Bare Mineral products (yes!).  And, have an impressive array of perfumes in their perfume section.  

The service is a bit spotty and I recommend always checking to make sure you received the sale price you were expecting on all your items before leaving.  It's not like it's a HUGE problem, but has happened enough for me to always check.

I went to my local store and saw some Whish products on clearance. I purchased some and went home and used them. Loved them and came back for more the next day. I loved them so much, I contacted family in Idaho to see if they could go to their Ulta to purchase for me ( I am in Indiana). My sister said she would and went to the Boise Towne Square Location on Milwaukee. She got there and saw a full shelf of product, (she sent me a pic) but it was not on clearance. I asked her to see if she could get a price check on it. She asked an associate if they could price check it for her. The associate took one to the register and it rang up 1 cent. My sister said the associate looked like a deer in headlights, like something was wrong. She called over her manager (Alicia-spelling might be incorrect) and the manager told my sister that this was incorrect and that the product is no longer for sale. I sister called me and told me this. This did not make sense, so I called the manager myself after my sister had left. She told me that the product is defective and that they were all testers and they can not sell anything. That she has to return it to the manufacturer, that they wont allow her to sell anything. Still, this made no sense. What made sense to me, was this was supposed to be on clearance, this store did not have their act together and have it marked on clearance, and perhaps it was time to get rid of the product.She told me AT THAT Very moment the product was being pulled to send back to the manufacturer.  At this point, there is nothing she or I could do. After that conversation, I reached out to Whish company themselves and wanted to verify this information. Just as I thought, the response I got was that it is up to the STORE, not the manufacturer what they do with the product. They would not be requesting this product back. I let them know that this store is OUTRIGHT refusing to sell it to me, and I believe it is because of a  mistake they were making but did not want to admit to it. I was told again, that this is Ulta's issue and that is had nothing to do with them. My reply was very courteous and informative. My husband decided to call and talk to the manager. He was told that there was NO PRODUCT but some self tanner to be sold. (This is contrary to what she told me and my sister-before she was not allowed to sell anything!) She also said that it was not on clearance and would not be (same thing she told me). My sister came back the next day to see if in fact this was true.  SURE ENOUGH, my sister found shelves of product FOR SALE and ON CLEARANCE! She sent me pics of this as well as the original shelf where she saw the product the day before. This is OBVIOUS they messed up and were correcting what they did not do, all the while lying to me, my husband and my sister. Against my better judgment and giving this store ANY BUSINESS, I had her purchase what I wanted, because I could not get it anywhere else on clearance. That night, my husband called and talked to the manager again. We have both conversations on recording because his phone defaults to this in case we need it for anything. This blows me away...seriously. This manager replied to my husband after he noted that my sister went in and saw shelves on product and on clearance for sale...that it must have been product people returned. She said that she has no idea how that product got there and marked on clearance, because SHE is the one that did what ""little"" product they had. My husband told her we have pics of the product they have, she said again, she did not know how it got there. She failed to admit that this product was NOT to be sold as originally noted, she did say that perhaps the manufacture sent MORE!!! She said that there was some mixed up information provided to him and me and my sister by someone that thought they knew what was going on.

I have been to their salon and esthetician too. I just had my hair cut by Erin, she took the time to listen to me and I was over all very happy with the end results. The facials are a little awkward. I tried them out only because a friend had recommended them. And they seem to always have openings. They have you wear the velcroed gown but you have to walk around the corner to the bathroom to change, in the store full of people. Thankfully they aren't terribly busy in the back by the restrooms but it's not always just women in the store. The area where you have your facial done isn't fully closed off from the other customers either. So someone shopping the dermalogica line can in fact walk in on you.

I don't like that the area where the facials are done is basically open to the store. Changing is an interesting experience so wear a tube top or tank top.

They have consultants who are available to help color match you (#PRAISE), answer questions, and help you find the right products for YOU. A few years ago, it was suggested to me by one of their consultants that I use Bare Minerals. Three years later, and I've never looked back. My skin is very happy with this makeup, plus it wears really well throughout the day! (If you're exploring makeup options, I highly recommend trying out this line.)

Beyond Bare Minerals, they also have a great selection of other products from Too Faced (love their ""lip injection extreme"" lip plumper), to drug store brands like Loreal (their voluminous mascara is my fave), as well as hair products, and nail polish/utensils.

The staff is amazing and very helpful. I visited the salon for the first time yesterday and my stylist Debra was the best. She did a simple cut and style all while I had my 8 month old in my lap. I will definitely be using Debra as my regular stylist now.,2014,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,3

The selection of cosmetic and skin care items was enormous and varied, and well- priced. The staff were extremely helpful, fun and friendly. At check out I signed up for their loyalty program and received a sample mascara .

They also have dermalogica products. Once I got facial done. I really liked it. I also got my hair done once for an event. They did a great job. My hairstylist is really good lady. Customer service is good. They have different brands like urban decay, nyx, naked etc. I love shopping there.

I was able to purchase an item there that I could not find n Westshore or International Plaza so it was great not having to order on-line and it was priced competitively . I'll be back ...",2018,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,4

The ladies in the ""prestige"" makeup section really listen to your questions and give great suggestions. I was lost on what brow makeup to buy since I drastically changed my hair color -- and I was provided with several follow-up questions on my preferences for formula, price range, color, etc. They even thought to bring me up to the store window after application to really get a look at the colors in different lighting. Five star experience.

I recently went in for a hair cut with Hali - she was super sweet, easy to talk to, and almost had a sixth-sense about what I wanted. If you're looking for salon services, I highly recommend her!

Aside from the fabulous service, you can't beat the coupons and huge variety of stuff available, from drugstore brands to high-end.",2015,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,6
T2EmvnFs-vbyrWwDRulk0Q,hczzraTsDaGJNQV-fnK8hw,5.0,"I have been going to the Clearwater Ulta Salon and getting my hair done by Brittany Cooper/Bishop for about a year now on a regular basis. Britt is truly passionate about what she does and it shows that she enjoys her career as she is constantly taking the time to learn and progress to become even better than she already is (if that's even possible!). She really will go above and beyond for her client from what they would like done to their hair to easy scheduling. Britt is perfect to go to for any hair need such as cuts, colors, and even hair extensions. When you are in the salon chair with Britt, it's like hanging out with a friend. She is truly a genuine person. After going to Britt the first time after going to other stylists at various high-end salons in the area, I knew I never needed to go through the search of finding a stylist who would fit my hair needs and budget. I have very long hair that I want to keep long and healthy, I trust Britt 100 percent as she is always on point and delivers more than you walk in expecting every time.

I asked about the rainbow color under my hair and just said I just found out about it. She pointed out it had been around for years but never asked if I wanted to know more. Then I asked before I left about just getting my hair colored and the length charge because my hair is long. Once again, she told me no one had called it that in years and told me it depended on how many tubes they needed to use. To me it was the same difference but it seemed to make her feel better making me feel stupid.  She never even smiled or said we hope to see you again. I went up front to pay and when the cashier asked me if I wanted to leave Jessica a tip I said no. Never an inquiry why. When she mentioned enrolling for the rewards program I told her I would not be back. Once again, no inquiry why.

There has been a transformation to the attitude of the employees or there is a new team. They were so helpful and went above and beyond to wow me. I was planning on placing an on line order but went to the store to check a color for a lipstick that was an on line only sale. The staff was so kind and helpful I made my purchase there.

ViB5JewsCy9n0wWQ2rYaGA,hczzraTsDaGJNQV-fnK8hw,1.0,I like ulta because it has high end products as well as drug store brands and products. I don't like ulta because of their shelfing and product organization. Can't find anything.

vjNZeXLrGb1kt3hZgcJgcA,hczzraTsDaGJNQV-fnK8hw,5.0,"Britt is everything you could want in a stylist. Not only is she talented, which obviously... look at her work, but she is also HONEST.
I value that more than anything. She cares about the condition of your hair and wont agree to do something that will damage it. Even if someone else told you it could be done, believe her if she says it's a bad idea. Britt won't make promises about your hair that aren't physically possible. She isn't going to mislead you just to take your money.
If she tells you you need a treatment... you need a treatment. If she says you need a cut... you need a cut. She isn't shy about taking a photo to show you exactly what shes talking about. If anything, you'll need to reevaluate your friendships after she shows you what they've been letting you walk around with 
I'd 100% recommend making an appointment with her if you want to be satisfied with someone who has your hair's best interest at heart. I think she's also in the running for Best of the Bay... vote for her!",2019,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,8

Outside of the salon everything is organized and easy to find and so much variety. Very well managed. Everyone's nice at this location.

My only complaint about the salon is I wish it was more closed off to give you more of a salon relaxation feel but at least it's all the way in the back.",2015,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,11

She's a make up artist there and wow she is so knowledgeable about not just make up but what products will look good on you along with what fits with your needs. She was funny and energetic, really knew what she was talking about. She recommended me the right kind of make up for what I needed. I told her I'm sensitive to certain brands and also love the more natural look. So she walked around and picked up products for me to test and voila, I walked out feeling so happy and confident about my purchase. No buyer's remorse because I have concealer that matches my skin. An eye palette for everyday use that is easy for travel with. And a nice kit for skincare to illuminate and soften my skin. Anyways, love going to beauty stores with staff that knows their stuff. Find Heather when you go there, she's like the girlfriend or sister you always needed to teach you about the do's and don'ts about makeup. She has a keen eye for color and will be real with you if something doesn't look good. Great experience, will be coming here for makeup needs now!",2016,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,10

I also love their events and their makeup/makeovers.  It's not like Sephora where you have to buy something.  I LOVE their Dermalogica products and Tiffany does a great job with facials.

OC8PVAyPUzbXOF47G3yhKg,hczzraTsDaGJNQV-fnK8hw,1.0,"I went to Ulta knowing I was going to drop a pretty penny on some makeup. I needed a new shadow palette and contour palette. 

Number 1, apparently the ULTA in CLEARWATER FL needs a new stock team/manager whatever. Everything I tried to look at and liked was out of stock. That was AT LEAST 3 different shadow palettes and 2 different contour palettes.

Then the store associate directed me to a MORPHE palette. Iv heard of this brand but I don't know much about it besides Jefferee Star talks about it on his little channel. So I said ok the colors in this palette are nice and wow it's so cheap I wonder why? But thinking oh it's Ulta they have good products even if it's on the side cheap side of the store. I take it home not thinking to even look at the ingredients or where it's made. Today I flipped it over and I found out it's made in CHINA. NO WONDER why it's so cheap. These products everyone rave about, contain some not so nice ingredients in them that can harm you down the road. Not to mention it's not cruelty free. Especially coming from China. 

Hey Ulta get it together and train your staff better. When someone comes in looking to spend at least $100-$150 on new product and the store associate points me to the $12 product, talking about how great this brand is. No thanks.",2019,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,10

nikWYL-y5ZEWdVK9a3XAyg,hczzraTsDaGJNQV-fnK8hw,1.0,"I'm happy to see that Melissa D at the ulta salon has plenty of great reviews, I wish I had the same experience. She reached out and told me to come in later for my appointment, then ran an hour over when she told me to come in. I came in with hair healthy enough to stand a color correction, I had a consultation with 4 other stylists & loved Melissa's energy so I booked with her. Lightener was left on my ends for 30 minutes, applied incorrectly and not close enough to my outgrowth, while she walked away to get her lunch & eat. You don't leave lightener unattended like that. Then came back and applied lightener to my regrowth & the dark, precolored spots it should have originally been applied to and let that process for an additional 30 minutes. When she finally rinsed me out, she was calm & cool until walking away & coming back freaking out about how my hair was breaking & that this was my fault bc of previous colors, insisting that I cut 4-5 inches off of my hair. I told her to tone me & stop service bc i no longer trusted her with my hair, in which she continued applying different products before finally toning my hair. I spent 35 minutes crying at the shampoo bowl bc a stylist I put faith in failed, as a stylist the integrity of hair is most important and at no point did she offer other options during the lightening stages. I was open to options if I could not reach my end goal, but she instead chose to ignore the integrity of my hair for an end goal, thanks for the hot roots. The whole experience was awful and unprofessional, leading back to her rinsing a test strand out of my hair by having me crouch next to the shampoo sink with a towel over my face & getting my face all wet. I should have stopped service when I originally was concerned, but I figured there was a reason she was doing things the way she was, although no other stylist I know & was speaking with during my service condoned any of the things she was doing. I now have ridiculous amounts of breakage that have to be cut, and a chemical burn from lightener on my scalp. The store manager said that they cannot do anything for me unless I come in during certain times, I do not live local nor am I waiting to have my hair cut to fix the damage or see a doctor about the chemical burns. I still paid, and I still tipped. I will cut my losses and accept the loss of money, because that wasn't even the concern, I was looking to be heard by management, not told how great Melissa usually is. What a way to conduct business.",2021,MO,Misuri,27.9591592,-82.72663137,Y,1

I had a problem with my coupon that was not correctly applied towards my purchase/exchange and I came back to correct it. The girl working there did not understand the situation and wrongly believed that it was already applied. She tried to convince me, I tried to explain her her mistake...
Instead of apologizing and correcting mistake she became confrontational and started to have an attitude. She called her manager saying very loudly ""I have a customer who does not understand the coupon!"" (in front of everyone).
The manager came and she was also giving an attitude (I won't go into details about what else she said) but after 10 minutes of explaining them how the system works they understood the mistake and gave me the promised discount. They admitted I was actually right, but it was no apology just disrespectful glares.
I don't want to go back to this location where employees are not properly trained and are disrespectful.

I even had a decent facial here once - though I will say the facial area could benefit from a makeover itself; it seems a little makeshift and not immune to the noise from the sales floor.

On the other hand, I have been let down a few times by the inventory here. Not that the store doesn't have a decent selection of brands, they just seem to be out of things quite often. And, of course, such things are always best-sellers and the exact product I am looking for. An example: the Pur Minerals color-correcting primer for red tones....I love it and it works, but after two different trips to ULTA to get it and discovering they were out, I broke down and bought the Smashbox version at Sephora. If it's that good of a product, why don't they stock larger quantities of it? 

I do think, overall, the staff at ULTA do a better job of keeping displays and testers presentable - and useable.

I then went to check out with a few small items I didn't really even need, and the associate helping me used my ulta rewards points without asking me if I wanted to. He said something about not having the birthday gift and threw ""next months birthday gift"" in instead. 
It is literally the second day of the month first of all. Second of all if they had said they were out I would have told them I didn't want the item and would have waited til the end of the month to see if anything else came at the tail end. I had my card on the table and he swiped it and was talking a mile a minute about it being the end of the night. When I saw he used the points, I told him I didn't want him to do that. And he got really disgruntled and then spent a few minutes returning and repurchasing the item, and after that said I would have to call customer service ""to fix my mistake"". Ok. 

Everyone has a bad day, and it was the end of the night. I get it. He seemed really nice just desperate to leave and there were still like 6 people in the store.

After pricing a few frequently used items here, i.e. make-up, shampoo and conditioner, perfume, I've found the items are no less inexpensive and all can be found online for a more reasonable price. The quality of the products are questionable, as well. I purchased a bare minerals make-up brush that shortly afterward the brush hair started falling out and the handle came completely unglued. The cherry on top was finding out it was exactly the same price as the brushes you can purchase at the BM store in the Fashion Mall. 

In my experience, when I have asked the staff questions about products or for help in the store in general, I have been met with passive attitudes and annoyance in their tone of voice. I have also noticed the lack of cleanliness and organization on their display shelves. This could be for a number of reasons and having worked retail before, I find this to be blatant neglect.

The white theme gets easily and visibly dirty, and some of the products smell rancid at times. Plus, the Ulta brand repeatedly disappoints me. The powder has that chalky look and not true-to-skintone colors; the lipsticks, while prettily shaded, tend to smell like old cosmetics.

I was feeling spontaneous on Monday, and decided to get my haircut on a whim. Nothing fancy, a few layers, a little shorter, it can't be that hard right? WRONG. I left the studio with a large drop in length on one side, while the rest of my hair was one length. I told the hairdresser at the time and she said ""it kinda looks like bangs, it'll be fine"". I left thinking I was crazy. I then called later after being told by a friend that my hair did indeed look odd. I called the store hoping they would rectify the situation. The nice lady on the phone said she would take care of it and to head on over. I drove 18 minutes (of a 20 minute drive) and I was called back stating ""the manager has to look at it- she'll call you tomorrow at 9 am"" I offered to send pictures to the manager to prove that my hair does indeed look bad, to which the lady on the phone said no... annoying. I drove home. Then today, I made sure I was free at 9 am. No call. She finally called around 11 am. The earliest availability (because the manager doesn't work in the evening?) would be Saturday in the afternoon. I even offered to come straight after work when I got off at 4:30 pm, and the manager stated she is leaving at 5 so she can't help. That would mean I have to cancel my weekend plans for a haircut. No thanks. So I decided to go to a different salon, pay extra, just to not deal with this place anymore. The lady at the new salon's first comment on seeing my hair was ""what happened to you?!""

This woman did my make-up and not well. She didn't show me how to contour at all. My make-up was cakey and I looked like a ghost. The worst part was the $50 price tag for the bad make-up job. Someone should have been upfront about the cost.

First time, I simply walked out. I still went back a second time, thinking it was a fluke, and had one of the worst experiences. I went in on Wednesday, January 31st around 8:40 and made my purchase at 8:47. 

As I was making my purchase, Erin, never said hello to me let alone ask me if I found everything alright. When I tried to present a coupon to use - she said it wouldn't work on sale items. I made my purchase and walked away without any questions. I moved to the side and read the fine print. Not once did it say anything about not being able to be used on sale items. So I went back to Erin and explained the situation. All she could say was ""oh"". She asked Charlie, the Manager, if the coupon was valid. Charlie said yes. As they were making the adjustment and giving me a refund, both acted as if this was such an inconvenience to them. It was Erin's fault to begin with. She should have read the coupon instead of assuming that it wasn't valid on sale items. 

Not once was there an apology from Erin (the original cashier). After Erin walked away, I asked if she (Charlie) was the manager and she said yes. I began to politely explain to her how poor Erin's customer service was and how I didn't even get a simple sorry for this issue. All Charlie could say was ""I'll address this with her"". Even Charlie didn't say sorry! I had to say ""you could apologize on her behalf"" and only after that did she I get a measly sorry and a full stare down. 

I called Ulta Customer Service right after this poor experience and filed a complaint with Dalton. I explained the situation. He informed me that Dana Aicher, the District Manager, would be in contact with me in the next 24-48 hours. I guess we will see if she makes an attempt at making this situation right before I try to go another higher route with Ulta Corporate. 

All in all, you're in the customer service industry. If you feel like you can't talk to a paying customer in a polite way, you shouldn't be dealing with people! 

I wish giving 0 stars was an option. Even giving just 1 is too much for how rude the staff is at this location. I guess it's my fault too though. I should have learned my lesson after my first visit.

Stay away from representatives selling mineral makeup. 

We all know and acknowledge that mineral skincare and cosmetic products are fantastic. But their sales people must be facing hard times, because once they have your attention, they will show no mercy. To the extent that they will follow you to the register to make sure you buy the items you have now been carrying for them. And then you'll get home with 5 different red lip sticks, because you originally were asking for help choosing one, and instead you got a full makeover and an eyeliner pencil and a lip thing and a bronzer and the first 4 lipsticks you were thinking about, and never got to make a decision on. And I genuinely liked this woman, I just wish she would have treated me more like her daughter and less like her meal ticket. 

If you're anything like me, you might go home feeling like you want to return it all tomorrow out of principle.

So my friend was like ""oh I just want to know if Ulta carry something like the Origin's Moisturizer."" And that woman Yelled at my friend...yes she Yelled at my friend sooooooooo loud even I was shocked. I was scared. That woman was like ""NO!!!"" 

I've worked in the customer service industry for years. You should Never..never ever ever Yelled at a customer so loud that everyone at the store can hear you. I thought that woman was possessed or something, like seriously why yelled so loud like that? I was like no way! The manager needs to know about this. But my friend was like just forget it. And this one other worker felt bad that she yelled at my friend, and she asked my friend if she can show her around at the moisturizers that Ulta has and see if any of them would interest her.

I will never come back to this Ulta. I am afraid of that woman. She is scary...no normal person would just scream so loud at her job for something so small unless she has psychological issue.",2014,LA,Luisiana,39.9500869,-75.1683553,Y,6

I usually have a fear of larger ""chain"" salons, as I've typically not had great experiences. I have long, straight, blonde hair that I just began highlighting about a year ago. I have noticed that my hair gets a really yellow/brassy tone every time, even though I always explain to the stylist what I like (cooler, more ashy blonde tones.)

I thought I would just be stuck with golden hair, until this weekend. I had a coupon from Ulta for a salon service, and thought I would give it a try. I booked an appt with Scott, and don't think I will ever let someone else color my hair ever again. He knew exactly what I wanted and wouldn't stop until I left the salon happy. I could tell even when my hair was wet that all the brassiness was gone!! He even recommended products to help me maintain my new hair, which I have subsequently ordered. Furthermore, he was incredibly personable and my two hours in the chair flew by with great conversation. He even gave me some great restaurant/nightlife suggestions, which I appreciate since I'm new to the city.

The rest of the salon employees were very nice, and kept offering magazines/refreshments. I don't find the downstairs store employees particularly friendly, but LOVED my salon experience and have already booked my next appointment.

I have very fine brows, so I usually self-maintain - but I'm unable to recreate the shape and arch that Dianna is able to achieve.  She is extremely meticulous - starts with wax, trims them with scissors if necessary, and finishes with tweezers to catch any stray hairs.  She will also fill your brows back in with Benefit products and will add concealer to hide the inevitable redness that happens when you get a wax.

With frequent sales/coupons, you can pick up a nice mix of low-end cheapies and higher-end products, generally at a better price than you would find at the drug stores or Sephora, respectively. They also have a wider variety of brands/products than the other stores.

Cons: I haven't found the floor staff or cashiers to be particularly friendly or helpful -- in fact, I'm not sure any of them have ever even asked if I needed something on ANY of my trips there. If you ask a question, they give a curt answer which 50% of the time is ""I don't know."" Not awesome. 

I also wish they had a better return policy and offered more samples like Sephora does.

The Salon: LOVE! I've had a variety of services here, with several different staffers and been very happy each time. Pricing is on par or a little cheaper than the local salons, staff is friendly, and they know their stuff.

The woman on the phone didn't seem to care and said that Dianna was with another customer anyways. However, when I got there (10 minutes late), she was still with that same customer and didn't finish up for at least 10 minutes more. I guess I am just glad I didn't show up on time?

I rarely get my brows waxed anymore because they're really not that out-of-control (I am a natural blonde with fine hair). But, I did this as a treat for the first time in two years. Dianna suggested a tint as well as the wax, but was not pushy about it. I decided to go for it and I am glad I did. Everything else was great- I loved Dianna's personality, and she is someone that you don't mind being all up in your face (some waxing services can be a tad awkward).

Maybe I'm biased as a frequent Sephora customer but I expected to be able to try high-end cosmetics before buying them. Unlike Sephora, there were no applicators or makeup remover set out, and half of the products didn't have a tester available. I also got dirty looks from staff every time I touched something, and at one point a security guard started following me around as if he thought I was going to try and steal something! I had on my professional work clothes and my purse was closed, so I have no idea why he would go through so much trouble to make me, the customer, feel uncomfortable. On top of that, floor staff was incredibly unhelpful - not only did they seem unfriendly, they also were not knowledgeable about the products at all. I ended up going downstairs, picking up only the eyeshadow I came for, and then making a bee-line for the check-out counter. If this is their business model I do not see how it could possibly be successful.

This location is a three-story flagship location which includes a salon on the top floor and a Benefit brow bar. You'll find prestige brands on the ground floor and drug store brands downstairs.

Staff seems friendly. They're there to help if you have questions, but don't get in your face if you just want to browse.

I had been wanting to try a new NYX foundation after a bunch of my friends have been raving about it. Ulta is the only place I knew sold it. It has been selling out like crazy, so Ive been checking in a few times a week on my way home from work to check it out. When it kept not being in the store, I considered ordering it online but decided i really wanted to test it first to determine which was the right shade for me, as that really depends on the product. I was thrilled to arrive at the store today and see that they had all 8 shades available!! Sadly, there was no tester available for the one shade i really wanted to try. Since there were testers for the 7 other shades, I decided to ask an Ulta employee if they maybe had a tester in the back I could try before committing to the purchase.

I walked upstairs, and approached an employee (her name was Taren or Taryn, not sure about the spelling.) Before I could even finish asking her about the tester. she put her hand to stop me from speaking, and begin telling me that they no longer leave testers for this product because they kept getting stolen. Now, this may very well be true, but seems unlikely to me as there were testers available for EVERY other shade, and testers available
for wayyyy more expensive and higher end products. When I went to make this point to her she again put her hand up and said, ""let me finish."" At this point, I was embarrassed and upset about how dismissive she was being so I said, ""Dont worry about it, I can tell Im inconveniencing you"", to which she abruptly turned and walked away.

Upset, I went to the register and asked the girl (who was very sweet and empathetic) if there was a manager available to speak with. As luck would have it, Taryn walked over and said she was the only available manager, to which I replied ""Nevermind."" She then laughed about it right in front if me, as if it were so funny that there was no other manager available to speak with. I was visibly
upset and she stood there and laughed. I immediately left empty handed and disappointed.

I would like to say that Ulta customer service has handled the situation appropriately, and this is much more about the individual than the store or the brand. I really hope that this manager improves her customer service skills as well as her basic respect for other humans. She may have been having a bad day, but she was truly heinous and it makes me nervous to think of encountering her should I shop at this location again.

I was attending a formal event and having my makeup done (not at Ulta) for the event so I thought it would be great to get my brows done prior to getting my makeup done.  I scheduled an appointment 7 days in advance, I left work early the day of the appointment, I arrived for my 5pm appointment and was told to have a seat.  I was then told that Diana was not in that day, i was immediately p*ssed off since this was planned in advance and there wasn't time for me to find someone else. Also, they had my number and could have called me to tell me that she wasn't in.  There were two Ulta employees there, one was trying to be helpful but the other seemed upset at the fact that I was upset. They also let me know that Diana told 'her regulars' that she wouldn't be in that day.

I don't care how good Diana is, she's not professional and the lack of customer service is appalling.

I like that they have a large selection of brands, anywhere from high-end to drugstore brands, & they have a huge selection of NYX, which I like because the only other place near me that sells that brand usually is picked clean of their items, & either way doesn't have as big of a selection. And their selection of Urban Decay is actually slightly larger than the Sephora down the road, which is important to me because that's one of my favorite brands. They also have alot of sales on their brand & the drugstore brands.

She was amazing . I still can't change my stars (yet) because the first experience was beyond the pale , but I hope this prompts a change .


How do you spell ""worst customer ever ?""
""C-A-R-M-E-N.""
Went in with my Mom today to treat her to some nice perfume and dr Brandt 's eye depuffer.
We were pointed to the ""back of the store ""
We were clearly looking around as 2 women talked amongst themselves --both obviously spotting us--both ignored us completely . Guess the conversation was more important . Stood there for about 20 seconds while they talked and then finally walked up and ventured to ask--the one girl finally helped us and was pretty nice --this Carmen chick , as her name tag pronounced --turned on her heels and arrogantly clicked away .

Fast forward to me purchasing said items for mom at register and more clueless looks from mindless automatons . My Mom asked nicely if they possibly had any samples (you would have thought she had asked for their first born child)

Rude rude rude .

Fast forward yet another time in the same DAY because I had sprayed a perfume I loved and wanted to return and buy it and figure out what it was .

Walked past the counter where not 1, but FOUR to FIVE sales associates were congregating and shooting the breeze. I was about 2 feet from them for at least 5 minutes obviously looking for something and still not one of them asked if I needed help .

Ask again --same girl , Carmen, Rudely turns on her heels while same sweet girl (wearing a head scarf ) and another associate help me.


See Carmen blandly poised at the register where she looks severely put out that she has to deign to lazily ring someone up.

I asked the girls who were helping me ""
Is that your manager "" (knowing that sometimes the manager will have better things to do than answer questions (not really !) and defer to the associates .

Nope . Not a manager . Just a brat .

And to top it off the whole back of the store is a hot MESS and jumble of racks that need to be Re shelved.

Wonder if these girls could be doing something useful .

I will return because it's right by my office , but not for the awful and rude customer service .

Went back today, and three staff were talking in the front. I asked if they had any appointments and was told she was going to get the book.

Awesome selection of products but I've been greeted by too many people that make it clear they are too busy to answer my questions.

My first experience I went to buy a new hair straightener and wanted advice on a good brand in my price range. Who would be better to ask than one of the hairstylists? Well she obviously didn't share that same enthusiasm because she was annoyed that I was even speaking to her, but that didn't make me stop because I needed something and I wasn't leaving until I was satisfied with my purchase.

My next experience I went to get matched for some makeup since I had recently started a new job and wanted to feel a bit more polished. My roommate told me Ulta would match me to foundation and even show me some makeup tricks to apply them... well here's my luck, I asked if someone could help me with this little makeup tutorial but I was told they weren't doing that at that time because they were ""too busy this time of year"".... let's keep in mind it was about noon on a Wednesday and I was 1 of 4 customers there.....they ended up hurriedly matching me to some makeup and sending me on my way.

Alas, I return because now I want to get more, I'm a little puppy eager to learn new tricks! I approach someone and ask for a suggestion on a liquid eyeliner and listed my needs. Employee points me to her favorite.... which didn't fit any of the criteria I specified. Thanks for taking the time to let me know what you like, not what I want! Love that! 

Oh and to top this all off, website hours said they were open until 9, I arrive at 7:55pm to pick up something and was greeted by a slammed door in my face by security saying they were closed. I knocked on the door until finally the manager came up and she was SO RUDE saying that it's not her fault the website says 9pm. I would think someone in a manager position could push to get that fixed..

I will say I have had a few interactions with employees that are incredibly professional and knowledgeable, so I will be back, but I wish I didn't have to feel like I'm walking on glass whenever I'm here.

I came in here looking for a specific concealer that was a part of their 21 Days of Beauty promotion, only to find that they didn't carry it in-store.  I felt so pressured to buy an alternative full-priced Stila product by a rep in the store, that I felt the need to walk away with the product, browse around and then returned it to the shelf later.  I don't need that kind of anxiety while I'm shopping!

I recently had a great experience with Lauren at the Salon.  In late May they were running a promotion for new Salon customers - $25 for a haircut and style (normally $45).  All I was looking for was a trim, and Lauren got rid of my split ends and I left with a head full of curls for way less than I would have at an expensive Center City salon.

 My sister and I brought our mother here for a full makeup makeover as a birthday gift. We were hoping for a MUA who could give a brief tutorial so we coud purchase ALL the products and she can do it later herself.

 Upon entering the store we were told to go upstairs to check in.  We were RUDELY spoken to by a hairstylist who didn't even look up when we asked to check in and just curtly said go downstairs, we told her we were sent upstairs... and she SCREAMED for another woman to come help us... (who happened to be sitting in the corner just watching, not even attempting to help)  She then denies we have an appointment, until we show her confirmation and she just goes ""oh your right here""????  Makeup artist was completely unprepared for us.

This doesn't seem that bad, but when your mom gets all dressed up and excited for  a rare moment of pampering...... !!!!  It just STARTED the experience off on a bad foot, oh but wait.


Finally she is seated for her makeup, the girl is nice but honestly it doesn't make up for the rest of the s*** show:

1. The makeup area is by what looks like the workers break area, thats fine, but its not fine when there what looks like day old chinese food and trash everywhere. I added a picture.
2. She applied moisturizer and primer with HER FINGERS.. EWWW, and I didn't see her wash her hands IMMEDIATELY before.... again my mother is being pampered im not going to interupt and make her feel grossed out.  She used brushes from a big tuberware container full of makeup and other things for the rest of the appointment which is again unsanitary
3.  The originally rude hairdress... proceeds to chomp on doritos about two feet away from my mom getting her makeup done and just watches?  in what world is this not annoying and bizarre.... then washed her hands without soap  and went back to the girl who's hair she was coloring =)
4.  A random customer came up out of nowhere and started asking questions, and the makeup artist left my mom sitting there for 10 minutes while she went to help her....where are the other workers?  It was a saturday evening!? 

Overall, her make up looked ok.  Nothing I couldn't do myself but its extremely frustrating that they got 300$ from us (again for the sake of my mom and her gift we didn't raise hell).  My sweet mom tipped her, and the makeup job was 45 dollars, plus the product that we bought.

My friend who's visiting me from Asia wanted some american makeup products so I took her to Ulta. She was excited and happy how big this beauty store is and literally wants to buy everything she sees, until she noticed that the security guard has been following us for the past hour. I brushed it off and tell my friend to ignore him and we walked away to see another brand.

I finally got ticked off when I catch him checking every makeup packaging to see if we stole anything. He literally opened every package that was on the stand we were at a minute ago and see if the package was empty. And he continued to followed us. (creep) 

As we were in line to purchase our stuff, my friend told me she wanted to switch another shade of a foundation. So I went to the basement floor real quick and change the shade. When my friend was in line, she noticed that the security guard was whispering to one of the register lady and he pointed at my friend and pointed down (assuming me, because I was in the basement floor at the time). 

As we were heading out, he walked beside us and perhaps expecting for the detector beep. But guess fucking what? It didn't. 

I personally think it was very rude and unpleasant of him to follow us to every corner of the store and assume that we were stealing. I come here a lot and wandering around to find the right kind of makeup is pretty normal. But for him, it didn't and made us look suspicious for no good reason. My friend felt uncomfortable and made her experience at Ulta horrible.

Update: I read another review and this reviewer (20 yr. old asian woman) claims that the manager sent the security to escort her to the door and they assumed she was stealing.

My negative rating has more to do with the overall experience. I was at the store by 11:15 for an 11:30 appointment. I was told by the manager that it would be ""just a little while"" until the girl doing make up on the first floor was done with her client, so I patiently waited and walked around the store.
When the girl doing make up on the first floor was done, she told me I'd be seeing someone upstairs, so she took me up there to wait...for 20 minutes. By 11:45 I went down to the manager and asked if someone would be with me soon, only for her to take me back upstairs to wait some more.

When my makeup artist was finally ready for me, we went back downstairs...after all of this running around and insanity, I didn't sit in the make up chair until 12:15. And, like most of their clients I am sure, I was pressed for time and rushing to get to a wedding. Ultimately this is unacceptable to me. You can't have stylists so behind in appointments that they make people wait for 45 minutes WHEN THEY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED. Ultimately there was little creativity offered to provide better service, and I left very unhappy.
As for the make up, it wasn't what I wanted, but it stayed put and I received many compliments. I'm not sure how else to convey the look I wanted other than showing a photo and asking them to aim for it...yet somehow there was still something lost in translation as I walked out with chiseled eyebrows and dark eye shadow, after I'd requested a more natural style.

This review is for The Salon and their service. I made an appointment online with Lauren at 3:30 pm for NYE. Then, I called to make sure that they were going to do what I wanted and also wanted ask for make up services. I wanted to get the Finger Curls. Got a guy on the phone who suggests that I book the appointment with him as Lauren didn't know how to do what I wanted.  His name is Ramon and he put me for 5 pm. 

A friend of mine asked where I was going to do my hair and I told her about Ulta. She made an appointment with Stephanie at the same time, 5PM. We both go there on time. I had been at Ulta before for their promotional blowouts and have been satisfied. Little did I know that some of them, that's all they know! I will further explain.

So, Ramon takes me after he was done with the last appointment. When I got there, I greeted them and said that my appointment time was 5 pm and that I wanted to get the finger curls. They had a manikin out with something called the Victorian Curls which was something that I did not want. So I show to him a couple of pictures so he knew exactly what I was looking for.

He washed my hair very quickly and started to ""complain"" by saying how much hair I had. Bla, bla, bla. But he was willing to finish with me before or around 6 PM. He knew what he was doing. He was almost done with the top part of my hair when Stephanie comes in and asks him to take her client/my friend as she wanted an up-do and she had no idea how to do it. So, he leaves me half/way and then she takes over. I was a little confused by the switch. At the end, I was there because I had no idea how to do that style myself. When I sat on her chair, though I couldn't see her face by the way of how she turned the chair, I could feel that she had no idea what the h*** she was doing. Stephanie started at the bottom, on the opposite way of how Ramon initiated it. Bottom line, I ended up getting a sort of blowout instead of finger curls. Curls were going in many directions.  I went home and fixed it myself a little bit.

Went in with my Mom today to treat her to some nice perfume and dr Brandt 's eye depuffer.
We were pointed to the ""back of the store ""
We were clearly looking around as 2 women talked amongst themselves --both obviously spotting us--both ignored us completely . Guess the conversation was more important . Stood there for about 20 seconds while they talked and then finally walked up and ventured to ask--the one girl finally helped us and was pretty nice --this Carmen chick , as her name tag pronounced --turned on her heels and arrogantly clicked away .

Fast forward to me purchasing said items for mom at register and more clueless looks from mindless automatons . My Mom asked nicely if they possibly had any samples (you would have thought she had asked for their first born child)

Rude rude rude .

Fast forward yet another time in the same DAY because I had sprayed a perfume I loved and wanted to return and buy it and figure out what it was .

Walked past the counter where not 1, but FOUR to FIVE sales associates were congregating and shooting the breeze. I was about 2 feet from them for at least 5 minutes obviously looking for something and still not one of them asked if I needed help .

Ask again --same girl , Carmen, Rudely turns on her heels while same sweet girl (wearing a head scarf ) and another associate help me.


See Carmen blandly poised at the register where she looks severely put out that she has to deign to lazily ring someone up.

I asked the girls who were helping me ""
Is that your manager "" (knowing that sometimes the manager will have better things to do than answer questions (not really !) and defer to the associates .

Nope . Not a manager . Just a brat .

And to top it off the whole back of the store is a hot MESS and jumble of racks that need to be Re shelved.

Wonder if these girls could be doing something useful .

I will return because it's right by my office , but not for the awful and rude customer service .

I went on Monday afternoon around noon looking to buy my mother a new brush set for Christmas. A skinny woman who had very dark hair, heavy makeup and looked to be about 40 told me she would be with me in a second. 

When I asked her where the brush sets were, she said something along the lines of ""We have a company that makes great brushes downstairs"" and instructed me towards the elevators/stairs. When my friends and I got down there, we were surprised to see that the lower level was all lower end cosmetics, and the most expensive, bad quality brush set down there was around 20$ max.

I am so offended that the woman was so judgemental and sent me to look at the cheap products instead of even showing me the more expensive options. I am by no means poor, and I was dressed nicely enough, but apparently the Ulta worker that was on her high horse deemed me uncapable of spending more than 20$ because I am in my 20s. While I was looking upstairs on my own, my friend heard her say something to another girl asking for help something like ""Well everything up here is going to be really expensive..."".. To which the girl responded ""So? Could you please show me anyways?"" Unreal.

You work at Ulta for a living. You are not better than any other human being, so please have the respect to treat every customer equally because you know nothing about them. I have never encountered such a rude employee. 

I ended up buying a Too Faced teddy bear hair brush set that I found on my own, no thanks to her. Ulta's products are great. I wish I could say the same for all of their employees. What a disgusting and judgemental woman.",2013,LA,Luisiana,39.9500869,-75.1683553,Y,12

This review is specific to my experience with the stylist named Helgada.  This review is not about the store

Not sure what prior experience Helgada has, but her skills are too bad even for Great Clips.  Doesn't listen to client request at all.  

-I told her I specifically DO NOT use a straightener on my hair and she looked at me like I have 5 heads.  If you know how to blow dry hair properly then there's no need to use a flat iron to reduce frizz. 

-I  asked multiple times for a concentrator to be used on the hair dryer, she told my multiple times it's not needed and that I'll see once she's done.  Finally she tells me she doesn't have a concentrator because she doesn't use them.  

-I don't know any legit hair stylist who uses a round brush to comb out dry hair.  Are you trying to damage my hair?! No I'm not talking while hair is being dried, I'm talking about when hair has been dried, then running a round brush down it from roots to ends ike Rapunzel combing her hair.  

-Icing on the cake was finally me asking her for the hair dryer and brush to fix it.  She wanted to know what exactly I didn't like about it.  Nicest way I could put it was ""all of it"".  So I finally trying to fix it myself to look halfway decent.  She then rushed to the register to print out my bill.

Ended up tying it back into a bun since it was just too pathetic to walk out with.  $45 for really just a wash, since I did the ""styling"" myself.

I called a month in advance to schedule an appointment for a hair donation, and I asked the lady on the phone (whose name I unfortunately can't remember) if my haircut would be free, as many hair salons do free haircuts when customers donate their hair. I also asked if Ulta would ship my hair to donation organizations. I was told yes and yes. One month later, I came to Ulta unprepared to pay for a haircut, but I kept five dollars cash in my pocket to tip my stylist. 

When the stylist cut my hair, she didn't use my natural part. In fact, she didn't use much of a part at all. My hair's new natural part is a crooked middle-part-gone-wayward part, and I have not used it since because of how poor it looks. After cutting my hair, the stylist washed my hair, did some more trimming with the same part, and then sprayed a few things in. She tried to blow out my hair, but I told her I don't like heat.

I nearly left the Ulta but was then handed a $70 bill (with a 20% first-time discount) and a plastic bag with my hair to donate (I had to send it out myself). 30 minutes of time and zero styling does NOT cost $70. Also, I was told on the phone that my cut and the shipping of my hair would be taken care of. 

I talked to the manager and she eventually lowered the price to $30. She said that *I* misheard the woman on the phone, and that the woman on the phone must have meant that Ulta will ship out my hair for free. Oddly enough, Ulta was not shipping out my hair for free anyway, so the manager's refutation was nonsensical. When I asked about adding the 20% first-time discount to the $30 fee, the manager said that going from a $70 cut to a $30 cut WAS my discount. That is not a discount. That is me paying the appropriate amount for the cut I received. 

I paid for the cut, and I kept the cash I set aside for a tip in my pocket. One could say that just like how a $30 cut WAS my discount, a $30 cut WAS a tip.

So balayage is all the rage right now and I wanted to change up my hair. I did some Yelping and Ulta did it the cheapest compared to other salons so I thought I'd give it a try. Making an appointment was easy, they have evening and weekend hours. I was set up with Kelly. The salon is conveniently located in Center City, clean and has ceiling/floor windows so you can people watch which is nice. 


Ok, so the fact that none of my close friends can really tell that my hair is different after I paid some decent mula, is a little disappointing. I never said I wanted it to the be super subtle. Obvi balayage is most subtle than ombre/highlights, but it should still be noticeable. It doesn't resemble anything like the pics I showed her. So I feel like my hair is just damaged from the dye but without color... fail.

So it's your one stop shop for trying new things, picking up a ton of stuff, and comparing whether or not you want to splurge on that oh-so-in fuschia lipstick. Plus they have hair products including shampoo/conditioner/hairspray stuff and also straighteners/brushes/clips.

With regards to drug store brands, they have almost those brands' entire collections so a lot of colors you won't find at the drug store. And fun fact: NYX is super cheap but owned by Urban Decay! 

The first floor is fragrance/skin/high end makeup, basement is drugstore stuff including body lotions and top floor is hair WITH  a salon. Haven't tried it though.. 

So that's all fine and dandy and I can spend hoursss playing around and dropping some serious bank. 

My hesitation for giving a 5 star is because I don't find the people very helpful. When I ask them something they seem to just rave about the product without giving me an honest opinion and more than just ""Yeah it's fabulous!!""

She was so heavy handed in applying concealer around the delicate under eye area, I actually thought she was trying to hurt me on purpose and she poked me in the eyes several times. I wanted to remove my own makeup (due to the heavy handedness) and she got visibly more upset. Worst part, products she picked out for me were all wrong, but I only realized it when I got home. The concealer was shimmery even though I specifically said I wanted matte, no shimmer! The powder turned out 2 shades too dark for my skin tone. And she gave me a synthetic brush to use with the mineral makeup I was getting, even though you're supposed to use natural bristles with mineral, and she even told me that herself!",2015,AB,A definir,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,10

Initially I received some great product recommendations during my first few visits to this store and since then the customer service has gone completely downhill. I've gone at various times of the day and sales associates are unwelcoming and unwilling to engage and interact with customers. Ulta is an amazing store with a great concept; they carry so many fabulous brands and wonderful products. I just wish the associates were friendly and willing to engage over the products. You know -- talk about what's new and exciting or what just came in and definitely needs to be checked out. The icing on the cake was when I asked a question while checking out and the sales associate said ""I have no idea what you just said I'm like half asleep BYE"" and shoved my bag into my hand. Not so interactive but again there have been some people here who have been friendly in the past. I guess it's just a hit or miss so it's best not to ask too many questions or expect awesome customer service.",2016,AB,A definir,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,1

I came in looking for a replacement foundation since my bottle is getting to it's last few drops, but unfortunately had no idea on how to choose a replacement. 

I wandered the drugstore type cosmetics (Revlon, Covergirl, etc) and while I tested some of the liquid foundations to find my shade, they still didn't seem quite what I was looking for. 

When I made my way over to the center area (where the more pricey cosmetics are, including my fave brand Urban Decay), a salesgirl by the make-up vanity setup asked if I needed help with anything. I told her what I was looking for and she helped me, first showing me tinted moisturizer (which I wasn't a fan of) and then suggested mineral powder foundation.

I decided to try it although I've never really been a mineral makeup kind of gal; however I was pleasantly surprised at the results. First off, it was cheaper than the heavy foundation stuff (which ran $34+ while the powder was $25) and it seemed more natural while still providing coverage.

This was a super experience since she spent at least 10 minutes helping me try everything on to see if I liked how it looked before helping me find one I really liked. Plus she didn't pressure me to buy anything extra (She told me about the accompanying powder brush for $22 for the mineral collection but told me it would work just as well with any brush).

zPNbKPAiRDr7W3USgktiXQ,ZsFOwyulu9PMDvA4dtBqsw,2.0,"I'll start by saying that I absolutely love their salon. Since I have been going there I've been getting the cut and color that I want without having to ask twice or stomp around angry for weeks because someone messed up my hair. I even had the confidence in my stylist to let her chop off six inches. It should be noted the last time my hair was to my shoulders was about 10 years ago. But I digress..

Though my shopping experience is always unpleasant in that store because everyone working there apparently takes a course in ""how to be rude and alienate your customer base 101,"" I am choosing to focus on my latest visit. 

I'm sorry in advance for the longwindedness of it all.

First of all, the store looks like crap right now. They're remodeling, which is probably a good thing, but it is dusty, the layout is confusing and cluttered and nothing is the same place from visit to visit. Merch has dust all over it, things are habitually out of stock, and signage is worse here than it is at the dollar store.

One of the reasons for my visit was that I was looking for shampoo and conditioner pumps. I buy the massive bottles of Redken - especially when there is a buy 2 get 1 sale (more on that later) because I feel like I'm wasting money if I don't. I also feel like I'm wasting money without a pump because once the bottle is past a certain level of fullness, it becomes a bitch to get out and extends my shower to the point where I throw it out because time = money. I called ahead and asked and they said they sold pumps. I looked online and found multiple makeup alley posts about buying pumps at Ulta. Thought I was safe. I was wrong.

I asked a woman who was wandering the store if she knew where they were. She said she didn't because she was only a skincare specialist (I don't care what your specialty is - you WORK there. Know the layout of your store, it's part your job). She looked around a little and said she would go ask someone to help her. Three minutes later I walk to the middle of the store where the registers are and she's standing there trying to sell a facial to someone.

Not. Cool.

If you didn't find an answer, it's unprofessional enough to just forget that I'm standing back there (with an antsy 2 year old) and start chatting up some old woman who needs more than you can give her, but what I suspect happened..that you purposely left me back there to get some commission might be the most unprofessional way I've been treated in any retail situation - ever. 

I decided right then and there that I was Yelping, but usually when I decide that I end up forgetting. What made me remember was the fact that the 67 year old cashier was rude, gave me dirty looks the entire time she rang up my things and then refused to honor the Redken buy 2 get 1 for two of the products because two were for men (the website EXPRESSLY says that they are included, and I plan to go back and shove the printout in their face, demanding my $20+ back). I asked her about the pumps and she sighed, rolled her eyes and walked away. After 2 minutes or so she came back and said that they don't have any signage for them so they must not sell them anymore. HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS ABOUT YOUR STORE AND PRODUCTS? I seriously don't understand how you can work somewhere and know absolutely nothing about what you carry, where you put it and when you no longer sell it. Sloppy. Unprofessional. Bad business.

To cap off my lovely shopping experience, she didn't ask if I found everything I needed, how I was, thank me for shopping, try to make small talk, ask me if I had an Ulta card (I had to prompt her) or seem like she gave a poop that I am spending my hard earned money in her place of employment, essentially paying her paycheck with my biweekly loyal purchasing.

Guess who just decided to pay someones paycheck at Sephora instead?

I hope management sees this and decides to retrain their staff. There is too much competition in this area (Sephora, namely) to treat customers this way.",2011,AB,A definir,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,5
oeJFLd5z0S0w0CZQmXm7fg,ZsFOwyulu9PMDvA4dtBqsw,1.0,"Only here to comment on the Ulta Nail Service: do NOT waste your money!!!  I went here to try out the OPI gel nails because I had a coupon.  The girl who did my nails was very sweet but she did a HORRIBLE job.  She got the polish all on the sides of my nails and under them and it looked like crap.  Plus the harded polish stuck under my nails felt extremely aggravating until it finally came out a few days later after washing dishes.  It seemed like she wasn't a real nail professional, rather just someone that Ulta sent to the OPI workshop to learn how to apply their product.  

The other really annoying thing was that it cost the same as a manicure ($30) but all she did was paint my nails!  She didn't trim my cuticles, or lotion my hands or anything.  I even asked her to trim my cuticles (they get very dry and I get a lot of hangnails, so that is one of the main reasons I get a manicure) and she said that she wasn't allowed to do that-  HUH?!?!  I will never get a nail service at Ulta again.

If you've never gotten a gel manicure before, here's what you need to know:  Once the gel is hardened you cannot get it off- you have to start over and take the entire layer of nailpolish off that nail.  If you try to pick at a stray piece, you will just end up ripping a chunk out of the gel, which is basically like a plastic coating on your nail; pull a little piece and the whole thing starts to pull off.  Gel is not like regular polish where if they make a mistake and get some on the cuticle they can just scrape it off, even after it's dry.  It has to be applied perfectly and any mistakes must be scraped off while its wet. Once it goes in the UV dryer and hardens, that's it.  

If you're getting gel nails you need to go to someone who's a perfectionist and has a lot of experience.  If you live near Chemical Rd, I suggest Universal Nails, which is next to the Genaurdi's on Butler Pike and Ridge Ave.  Also, the nail salon in Better Health & Tanning on Butler Pike is very good too, but not open on Sundays and Universal is.",2012,AB,A definir,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,8

My expectations were too high, I was expecting to walk into a salon that was professional and posh looking. This place is so unwelcoming and would not recommend anyone to go here. 

Let's start with the ambiance, there is nothing on the walls. Each beauty station has the basic oval mirror, chair and supplies. It felt like I was getting a haircut in someone's basement, not a salon, let alone salon whose reputation is based off of being a beauty store. The hair washing station was a mess and awkward; the client view is that of the hair dying tubes. There was nothing on the walls and they are an off white so you got to look at off white walls and a hair dye station. 

My stylist was Melissa and very nice, quite frankly, she should move on from there and find a better salon. She's nice, personable and just an all around nice person but that's not enough for me to go back. The stylist next to her flat out interrupted our conversation to complain about a client but this was after she came back to the wash area to complain how she is only doing hair cuts and will only walk away with $200 that day. I get you want to complain about your job but going to the salon should be relaxing and I shouldn't have to worry about angry blonde girls problems. Oh by the, thank goodness Mike texted you back, I was really concerned.

Lastly, would it hurt you to get some damn hooks for coats? The options were the floor or a chair. Seriously, invest in the $40 for a decent set of hooks to put in front of your crappy hair wash station, at least clients can admire other peoples coats.

Pros: Melissa was awesome and did a great job cutting my hair, decent price for what you get.

Cons: Talking crap on clients and poor ambiance.",2015,AB,A definir,40.10375372,-75.292363,Y,3

I received a confirmation text message and replied yes. I come into the salon at my scheduled appointment time and am met with a very rude employee.

She told me that the specific hair stylist is no longer working there and that I ""should have known"" because they ""called multiple times and left voicemails."" I told her that I did NOT receive any calls, only a confirmation text. She was annoyed with me and frustrated with my response - as if I was lying! She repeatedly told me they kept calling me. If that's the case, why was I given a confirmation text message? Why didn't I get a voicemail that stated my hair stylist was no longer there? Why would I even show up?! She also did not apologize for the miscommunication whatsoever.

She told me that I could get my hair done by someone else. I couldn't find time to make another appointment, so I went with the other stylist. I went in for a trim and ended up having to pay $45 for it! That just is not right.

Then came the removal of the bleach -- my hair was GREEN! I was panicked and was reassured that with proper toners everything would be okay -- but they kept insisting I had dyed my hair and this is why it was happening and when I told them I had not dyed my hair, they said it must be some medication that I was taking (which they then asked WHAT medication I was on and WHY I stopped taking it 5 months ago).
Marie had never toned hair before so she kept asking another stylist what to do -- which made me more terrified since she kept saying ""this has never happened in 30 years... I don't know what went wrong"". 
She toned it until it was yellow -- and not evenly. When I was getting my hair dried -- I said that I still saw green and she said she couldn't ""cover it all"". She kept saying ""sorry, I don't know why that happened"" and gave me the manager's card BUT I still had to pay FULL PRICE for having my hair BOTCHED.

I figured she did not do make up since I have never been to an Ultra store and not had someone approach me to see if I needed assistance. A woman nearby was helping a customer so I asked if she could help me as well. She then pages the woman who was stalking shelves who then responded by looking at me and saying ""What?"". I responded that I did not wear foundation so I needed help color matching. She responded with, ""Well I can't put it on for you?"". I said I realize that ... she handled me two disposable sponges and said, ""Well which do you think matches better?"". This was frustrating considering I made it clear this is why I needed help. I went to the other side of the store to look for help shopping for other products and there was not one other soul in the store except two ladies at check out.

Basically, if u can do the job that the staff is SUPPOSED to have the ability to do but can't, then ur good to go at this location. 
I always love Ulta, what could be better than a place I can not only get my high end products but also my drug store favorites as well. I can walk in and get my skincare, makeup, and hair care all in one place! 
This Ulta on the other hand always feels like a chore to go to. I go to this location because it's close by and there is a few other stores I like to go into within proximity to it, so convenience is key. BUT before I go I always do research, especially if I'm getting a product I've never used or one that's new to the makeup world. I go in and avoid the customer service staff, or ""experts"" as they like to call them, like the plague. 
One day I came in and got a highlighting product, this product recommended a certain brush. Turned out they were out of the exact brush so I interrupted an ""expert"", who btw was adding another layer of makeup to her already caked face, what alternative would he best for the highlighting product. She acted like she had no idea what highlighter was or what it was used for despite the fact that her face was so highlighted it looked like a unicorn had sneezed on her! Needless to say she was zero help. I won't ask questions again at this location. 
Final thoughts: 
Dear Ulta, when u hire someone as an ""expert"" then make sure they actually fit the definition of that word and that Ringling Brothers isn't their side gig.

I have been getting my brows done relatively consistently for almost 10 years now! That's 10 years in 4 different cities. Nobody has ever come close to giving me brows like Sierra at Seminole Benefit Brow Bar does. 

Sierra in particular is wicked talented at what she does AND she's as kind as could possibly be. She has become one of my favorite people, and to think I only even see her a few times a year. All the Benefit Brow girls here takes the time to consult with you before even touching your skin, to make sure they know exactly the look you want to achieve. They also discusses skin sensitivities/allergies etc... very thoroughly. Before any hair comes off your face they will map out with eyeliner so you know exactly what is going to come off. This means you will never experience the tragedy of leaving a salon with skinny little over waxed brows: AMEN. 

The process is very efficient. If I'm not in too chatty of a mood I can get in and out in under 15 minutes, easily! They also will do your brow makeup and concealer after the treatment, completely complimentary! I usually like to let my skin breathe after a wax and therefore decline this offer but for those instances when I still have reasons to keep my face on it's brilliant!

Let's play a game of 2 truths and a lie. 

1. I am a natural blonde
2. I do not own a hair straightener 
3. I have never cried in a salon 

Until recently all of these were true. However thanks to the remarkable...sensational...infectiously gregarious...not to mention GORGEOUS, Senior Stylist and Redkin Certified Colorist: Christin. 

For the first time I ~treated~ myself to a real ~salon~ experience. I get the hype and also I don't know if I can live any other way ever again. Christin worked quickly and kept me entertained, which made the fact that I was sitting there for like a bajillion hours less painful (literally). Something I didn't even think about until I experienced it was just how fun it was to be able to peruse and shop while the foils sat in my hair! Ulta is a magical land of glitter and smells and fun, how can you not have an amazing time exploring? 

I got a the double VIP experience, Christin colored, cut, and styled me. And Salon Manager, Bridgette did my wash, massage and blow out. I was facing away from the mirror during my blow out and couldn't see the color result until the end. The oohs and ahs from the gals working as well as my ever doting and loving mother, made me feel like an absolute MOVIE STAR. When she spun me around, it was confirmed: I had movie star hair!!! This is when the tears started. I was crying in a salon. 

This experience was 5 stars and then some. It came at a price and it was lengthy. But it was worth it. It was so worth it. 

I appreciated the attention to detail, the customer care, and the quality of services. I also am thrilled to report that the approach to safety during this time is TOP NOTCH. Masks, gloves, social distancing, it's all happening.

The scheduling system seems to be non cooperative and many times clients are left out the system. I tried to schedule online and never could the system to acknowledge the appointment. Once I arrived, there was still confusion as to who was going to do my makeup. 

I told Damaris that I wanted fresh, natural, daytime look -- like Joanna Gaines - make up but I don't want to look like I'm wearing make up. I told her to do the best that she could given I have hyperpigmentation. She instantly launched into her story about hyperpigmentation and how she was going to save me.

OKAY -

She pullout every Demologica product in the store and push product. The rep 'just so happened' to be in the store and would not stop pushing  going on and on about the redeeming qualities of the line.  I could feel Damaris compounding more and more make up on me, until the big reveal showed me as if I were going to a red carpet event.

She was complaining about her job to friends and didn't even acknowledge me. She acknowledged a lady that was older than me right away that was looking at the same make up as me. Wow. So rude. That lady didn't even buy anything.The guy at the Benefit counter was alright and helped me find a lip tint. I was just reading other reviews of this location and there seems to be an on-going theme that the customer service is very poor and most of the customers leave feeling disrespected by rude employees.

_1mdDKWNFYc5BbMaU1VNSw,QM6CnjtMLVUyOvIj07XFAw,5.0,"I'm leaving this awesome feedback for my stylist, Jenna. This girl is the BEST when it comes to Keratin treatments. Originally, I came in to have my Keratin done by another stylist, and it didn't work out. It was an expensive treatment, and Keratins are VERY different from brand to brand, so I think there was confusion on what this particular brand needed to go in successfully, and then there was some misinformation about after care, so of course the Keratin didn't stay in, it washed out right away and looked BAD. I've had Keratin treatments many times before, and knew it wasn't right, so I got in touch with the salon manager and was assigned to Jenna. 
Needless to say, Jenna busted A** to make it right for me. She did a fantastic job and really made sure every step was correctly done, every single step of the way. She made sure I had the right after care products and gave me advice on how to make the Keratin treatment last for the full 90 days, and then some, if I am diligent :) Jenna's super fun and hilarious personality was just icing on the cake. She is awesome and I had a blast hanging out with her while I had the treatment. Jenna will always be my stylists so long as I live in this area.

So I made a second appointment a week later with the same person- told her I loved it! I just need my root to match. At first she told me it wasn't possible, then she grabbed another colorist who said it was and helped for a large portion of the service ( kinda felt like my colorist was inexperienced and didn't fully know what she was doing). First round my roots were a hot orange so I had to be reglazed and then 2nd round my roots were an orange brown. She left me like that and charged me $85 on top on the $170 I had paid for the balyage the week before.

Wwy4PzR8-NMvrgaifHNcDQ,tGaPlSDHzEGHKnJkEdnDEQ,1.0,"The first time I went to Ulta Salon to get my roots, highlights, and toner done. Instead of matching my natural root color, they used a lighter color and my roots turned orange and, instead of the white/lightest ash blonde highlights I asked for, they put in dark gray highlights. They also up-charged a couple of treatments without telling me so my bill was well over $200+tip. The 2nd visit: I returned to get everything fixed with a more highly experienced stylist, Sarah. I told her I did not want any of the ""extras"" and that I wanted a highlight that complimented my sparkling, bright white 'grays'. She did a better job than the than the first girl, giving me the root color I asked for, but kept saying, ""I love it when women embrace their natural color."" Ummm, ok. I didn't say I wanted to be gray, just get rid of the brassiness in my highlights, but I didn't think much of it at the time. 
Well, I should've paid attention to that statement the 3rd time I came to get my hair done because Sarah ignored my requests and went for her own vision of me as a gray-haired woman. First, she used foils when I wanted balayage to give a few, strategically placed highlights. The foils added a tremendous amount of highlight in areas I didn't want anymore, and no root color. Next, she used a toner that was darker and grayer than the last so I looked ancient. I was very unhappy and said I never asked to be made a gray-hair. I'm middle-aged but she made me look elderly! Who ever says to their stylist please make me look older!!! 

The coup de gras was they called me and said that since I was unhappy with their work 2 out of 3 times they didn't want me back as a client---say what? Instead of trying to fix the issue they blamed me. They blamed me for their incompetence. The manager never once apologized for what happened or how I was treated. They returned the last money I paid, but kept the tip, which earns them the single star.. 

I went to Sally's right after that phone call and bought everything I needed to fix my hair; roots dyed to the proper color, added a few, balayage highlights, and got a bright white toner and it looks fabulous!

5B2vsX0LrG6IiQzo4ITaHw,TPUFZpI2RWEgJjOmLFtvCA,2.0,"This review is for the salon. 

  I called ahead and got an appointment for the same day, which was nice; plus, they were offering a Memorial Day weekend discount for new clients, which was a huge factor in my decision to come to Ulta.  Before I went in, I had long layered hair that went down past the small of my back.  I had been thinking about making a drastic change to short hair for a while (it's hot here!!) and I found several photos of the cut/style I wanted on Pinterest.  That was perfect, because I could bring in my phone, show the stylist all the pictures, and discuss them with her before we started.  I was very excited, and ready for change.  

My stylist was very nice--I believe her name is Rachel--and I enjoyed talking with her about my cut.  The very first thing I said to her when I sat down was that I was ""ready for something edgy--I've been rockin' variations of this same cut for about 10 years.""  That must have been the wrong thing to say.  She forgot the part about wanting to be edgy, and instead (I think) became really intimidated by the amount we were cutting off.  I wanted a steep A-line bob, but instead I got the frumpy bob my mom gave me when I was 12.  As she was blow-drying, she stopped and said, ""you look like you're going to be sick"" and indeed, I wasn't feeling so great.  Instead of an edgy look, I felt like my head resembled a mushroom.  There was barely any difference in length from front to back--there was no other word for it than FRUMPY.   I stayed positive, and had her go back at least 3 times to take more off the back to make the cut more like I wanted.  This was a drastic change, and I knew if I didn't walk out of the salon totally in love with my new look, I'd never convince my husband to like it.  After several attempts at getting my stylist to correct the cut, I finally gave up--I was afraid that we'd reached a threshold where more cutting would just do more damage.  In the end, I ended up with a puffy, uneven bob (the back looks like a kindergardener took a pair of safety scissors and cut off my pony tail) that only looks good if I use a small curling iron to give myself beachy ringlets.

All we wanted was her hair turned under, and told her that my daughters had would not do it without a lot of work and a good amount of product.

She proceeded to spray the tiniest amount of heat set in and blow dry it under, while telling my daughter that her hair was cut wrong and she could do this herself easily if her hair was cut correctly- her hair was cut two weeks ago and had lasted all day- So we go to leave and her hair is already popping out. I did not leave a tip.

This is not the first time we have dealt with weird stylists here.

I noticed that the larger woman with short hair who had greeted me at the front door was inconspicuously (I'm sure she was hoping she was) following me from department to department.. first through the make up aisle then the hair section. I actually stopped in the hair section and started asking her about straightening products they offered. She was very helpful with showing me a few items. 

I usually get my hair products from Aveda salons where I get my hair done so I'm actually rather skeptical of anything they had to offer. 

I then started browsing the skin aisles which are on the complete opposite side of the hair section and the larger lady with short hair seemed to find her way there too. I didn't say anything because I had nothing to hide.. but it's a horrible way to feel as a customer. 

I'm actually a licensed esthetician who has worked at Miraval, massage envy and European wax center in the past and am used to much more expensive products than what was offered ULTA.. I was here because I was completely out of face wash and moisturizer at home and instead of ordering my usual products online and waiting for shipping I would just rather go buy something. I had used Clinique as a teenager and my mother sold Lancôme as well and I knew ULTA had SOME of their items. 

I went to pay for my items and low and behold the larger woman followed me there and even had another worker come around from behind the counter while I was paying for my items to see if I had stolen anything there.. like I said I didn't say anything because I had nothing to hide but the entire experience was an embarrassment for everyone involved. 

Now I walked in wearing a $200 coach purse, my $300 lucky brand eye glasses, my Tommy Hilfiger sandals and was not dressed down.. the only  thing I could think of that COULD have made me look suspicious depending on the level of intellect the person had that was judging me, was that I was black.

Either that or they thought my shy, mousy appearance and careful scrutinizing of lotion brands was a red-flag for shoplifting. There were about 3-4 employees, and each one asked me if I needed help several times. They would stand near me and acted as though they thought it was a theft in progress, and with each check-in, they became increasingly more agitated that I was still in the store without purchasing anything (I was there a total of 15-20 minutes).

Do you prefer the Walgreens beauty department staffed with folks who will shrug and say, ""I don't know."" when you ask a question about a product or Ulta which is staffed with people who will just lie? Because I'd probably prefer the honesty of ""I don't know"" over a rapid tour of the bullshit department. 

When I stopped by to pick up a new lipstain, I learned two things:
- the stain I wanted was discontinued.
- I could only get good advice if I was buying from the premium side of the store. Oh, hello, $30 lip color I don't want. 

The store is divided roughly in half: premium stuff on the left as you walk in and ""budget brands"" on the right. If you are there for a budget brand, I hope you know what you want! There is very little help available for those folks. The stock is deep, deep, deep with a lot of options so you can find just about any product from just about any drugstore brand. 

On the premium side, you can get samples and color tests and hand-holding to walk you through your big purchase. Again, the stock is pretty deep there, too. 

Ulta occupies a niche of ""one step below Sephora, one step above Walgreens"" which works when you know what you want. But to explore, it's probably best to head to Sephora for the first round or go over-the-top and hit up the beauty counters at your favorite department store. 

Ulta def. left me cold. Although maybe my new lipcolor is the right color...?

First of all, Ulta is awesome because they have everything under the sun- beauty wise. If you are a girly girl, like me, this place is heaven. This particular store is not in a mall, so it's really big and everything is nice and spread out and easy to find.

I dropped in here looking for my favorite moisturizer combo: Olay Regenerist serum and Neutrogena moisturizer with retinol. If you want a couple of my beauty secrets, there they are- I use them both together. ANYWAY, I am always sure to buy these particular two products here because they usually have a ""buy one, get one half off"" deal on at least one of them. You just have to make sure you stop in at the right time. Sure enough, I was able to grab them for a great price. Yeah, it's only a few dollars cheaper than a drug store, but that kind of thing adds up.

They also have a really extensive perfume section and you can sample all of the perfumes before you buy them. This is a big deal, especially for someone like me who is obsessed with body sprays and perfumes (it must be the French in me).

I asked the sales associates before I checked out if there were any more coupons.  Complete silence so I asked again.  No one had an answer until finally one lady tells me there aren't anymore, they were handing them to people outside.

(1) Sign up for the rewards points. They add up quickly. 

(2) When the weekly flyer comes, put it in your car immediately. You'll swear you won't need it but you will. Saves an average of $5.00.

(3) If you buy Bed Head, Big Sexy Hair, Sensories Shampoo/Conditioner, any of the holiday store brand lotions, HEMP BRAND LOTION, or any of the fragranced cleansing cloths. Check out T.J. Maxx first. Literally (and I only use that word to say don't be dumb) half price next door.

Leah has gotten my eyebrows together! They are beautifully shaped and cooperating and she did it! 

Ok. Other reasons I'm in Ulta include the awesome selection, sales, and customer service. There's parking right out front & everyone that I've met in there is knowledgeable about the products and what they do. 

You need a conditioner that won't make your scalp oily? They have that. A primer to keep away the shiny? They know which one. A setting spray so all your flyness stays in place? It's right over here. You meant for your hair? They have that, too. 

True, they run out of certain popular items... Last time this issue popped up an associate checked the shipment that they were putting out to see if my item had arrived and not been put out yet. And then.... You guys... She helped me order it online. Even looked up my rewards card number so I could still earn points for the purchase.

That being said the last couple of times I've headed in here, I've felt that they're curbing their mid-level beauty products for higher-end makeup and hair products. So when I can't find the economically-priced makeup that I know is still available in drug stores like CVS, I get pretty bummed out. Also if you like glitter-y makeup, get it before seasons like Carnival and Halloween because they usually run out fast and don't restock very quickly. 

It would be great if they knew your purchasing history and could recommend a similarly-priced option when your usual buys are being discontinued in the store. The staff is still nice, though I feel like they could be more well-informed about alternative products.

I was waiting to write this review to see if ULTA would contact me back, because I have not heard from them I am writing this review. It was 1 week before my big birthday and I went in for a trim all around including my long bangs. The pro stylist did not  ask me how I wanted it, and then I decided to tell her what I was there for and as I ALWAYS get the same length, I asked for my bangs to flare out with the shortest length below my cheek bone. When the stylist turned me around towards the mirror, I see my bangs (a pinch amount of bangs) 1 inch away from my hairline! I of course flipped out by what I saw and was outraged because I was having a birthday celebration in a week and was left with just a pinch of hair right in the middle of my front hairline which did not blend into anything. My hair literally was sticking out like a little girl cutting her own hair. The stylist by the name of CC stated to me ""I'm sorry I was not able to see where you were pointing because of your mask"". Im sorry but me pointing to where I wanted the length had nothing to do with my mask because I'm pointing in the same place with or without the mask, it's still on the same place.

When shopping the items are clearly marked off by brands, the type of items such as lipsticks and the are separate from eyeshadow or mascara etc. While the store is easy to navigate by the signs posted on a Saturday everyone is ringing at the register. I walked around for about 10 to 15 minutes and there is no one to assist you on the floor.

After drying it, she started trying to curl my hair with a flat iron to make a body wave......

I get to this store and the person scans the tag and says I think I have it let me check.  Sure enough, she came back with it.  I get it home and my niece loves the scent I go back to the store a few days later and explain that I did get one from here a few days ago and could she check.  I explained that the previous sales person scanned the tag on the shelf and was able to learn that there were some 9or at least one) in stock.

e0KwXMhDqysmg8hq9x7aaA,RMD5mNJgyQ1FGO_5YDCrzA,2.0,"I tried Ulta's salon (Concord Pike, DE) for the first time last evening.  I made 5:15pm appt online which was convenient and allowed me to choose the price point I desired. I received an email confirmation as well as a phone call to confirm time and price.  In my experience, the prices range by expertise so I chose a $46 stylist from the range of $36, $41, $46, $56. I was also entitled to a 25% discount for the Salon. So far so good.

I checked in, was offered water and took a seat in the small waiting area by the desk. There was hair on the floor.
My stylist came by to tell me she was running behind and that someone would bring me back in 10 minutes or so.  She looked at my hair and asked what I wanted. That was my consultation.

As promised, I was brought into the shampoo area 10 minutes later by another sytlist. I sat, she left.
The floor was dirty...hard to miss since it's white tile. After a few minutes, she came back, barely uttered two words and proceeded to give a really bad shampoo. I could barely feel her hands on my head. She just touched my hair, which is short, so that was quite a feat.  Next came the conditioner, it was rinsed off as fast as it was put on and missed one side of my head. She brought me to a chair in the style station, again without a word and left. The floors in this area needed to be cleaned and swept. There was hair and a comb on the floor beside by chair.  The chairs were dirty and stained.

At 5:30p my stylist appeared, apologized again for the delay and started cutting my hair.  Although the chairs are capable of being raised, she never did that.  She did not take the time and care I expected from an experienced stylist. After a quick cut, she blew dry my hair.  She did not ask how I usually wore or dried it. I was not offered product - odd for a place that sells a boatload of stuff.  My hair looked a little like a helmit when I got in my car at 6pm but it was ok when I washed it this morning. 

All in all, this was a very disappointing experience. Calling this place a ""Salon"" is a stretch and while I could try another stylist, the lack of cleanliness will keep me away.",2014,FL,Florida,39.82605188,-75.54303718,Y,8

I asked Shanon to do that and not only did she do exactly what I asked, she gave me one of the best blow outs i ever had. WHAT AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE. She is amazing and a great listener.

So I had faith in her, she knew it was not light enough but proceeded to put color on the orange/caramel sections. She then realized after she was drying my hair that the color was not showing up. Be mindful this cost close to $300 with a tip. So she stripped my hair and bleached it a second time (bleach wasn't to my roots). The purple came out patchy and brassy. I had excessive dyed stains all over my skin. They rubbed my skin raw when trying to remove it and caused me to have abrasions and scabs on my forehead for 2 weeks.

In all, there was another half of the store I didn't even browse through, and what I did was only skimmed, because I felt so odd with every person in there being so obviously concerned with theft.

6GWaqDSEZixrljejinGz4Q,TuMQjYCumnFhWJV2ELwwxQ,1.0,"Well today was a hard day at my local ulta. My mom is gonna be visiting me for Christmas and I came in to try stuff on to get my wishlist together. Back home we only shop at sephora and are both VIB rouge because we love makeup.  My mom loves it, but I'm the real fanatic. I'm an only child. Very spoiled. My mom always indulges this passion of mine.
Which is why I'm so sad by my recent experience because my other experiences have been overwhelmingly good.  It's not good though going into the busiest time of year in terms of sales for a retailer to get it SO wrong.
I had found some brushes. I asked to see the testers of them so I could feel them. I was the most interested in an ""it cosmetic"" brush for cream and powder.  I have a Chanel silicon based cream bronzer that I want to use it with.  Right now it's my Laura mercier brush from when I freelanced, it's more than 10 years old but in great shape. I really just wanted something to throw in my crazy purse that would stay nice and was small.  Anyways, I was refused the option of feeling the limited edition holiday brush by it cosmetics . Instead she tried to talk down to me and tell me about the product in order to sell it after I repeated to her, I was not going to buy a brush I can't feel first. Is that really that crazy? As a veteran makeup artist, I'm not gonna know I love the brush until I feel it and fluff it. I don't need to use it I just wanted to fan it to feel the density of the bristles. I know exactly what I'm looking for, but I need to feel it.  The whole premise and success of a store like ulta and/sephora is this experience. Try before you buy. I'm so easy, I have a list in mind of what I want before I even get in the store. I clean up after myself. And I use testers hygienically. All I asked for was to feel a tester.
Because I was unhappy with her she then made a point to interrupt me multiple times while I was trying on makeup. I wasn't using the brushes and she took them away. Then when I needed a brush there was no associate around, so I cleaned a brush and used it. Then another associate came over to take the brush away rather than offer assistance to apply the becca compact. She came simply stated the brush was for employees and walked away.... okay if that's store policy I understand. But how was I supposed to try on the powder compact she interrupted me using-face half done? I'm baffled by the lack of customer service because I contradicted this power hungry manager.
She was in a dear santa sweater and I'm pretty sure she called herself the creative director. Honestly, if she is in a leadership position I fear you are losing business.  
In terms of how to train your employees better it seems pretty simple.  If they legitimately do not have the ability to make a tester of the brush or it didn't send one, explain that... don't just say no. It's too much because I KNOW ""it cosmetics"" would be appalled by her behavior.  
And the other associate, I assume acting under her direction to make me feel bad about using a brush they didn't feel was appropriate is a reflection on your stores lack of leadership and customer service training.
If I'm gonna spend a few hundred dollars and my mom easily double that in any given visit to a beauty store, we expect a lot more.  There are three ulta stores in town, the Mae Anne location is next to the dog park and was my favorite. Sephora is in south Reno, so I almost always go to ulta first.  Now, I'm considering making the drive to sephora or trying a different ulta.
I hope this is helpful from a training perspective.",2017,PA,Pensilvania,39.52978792,-119.8662468,Y,12

They were obnoxiously trying to find someone to cover the shift then continued to talk about how poor of an employee Amanda is because she ""doesnt do good at registers"" and they were repeatedly saying how registers arent hard and how they think shes going to quit. I heard everything loud and clear and i couldnt believe it. I hope Amanda sees this review and gets a new job where shes appreciated and isnt gossiped about. Shame on you guys. Its rude and unprofessional and customers like me dont want to hear it. Save that crap for the break room. On the bright side, a girl with black curly hair helped me several times today with purchasing items and she was awesome. Ill be back only because i love ulta. But to the employees i was talking about, be careful about what you talk about at work because you never know whos listening.",2021,PA,Pensilvania,39.52978792,-119.8662468,Y,10

The staff is very friendly.

They also have a salon on property.  I've never tried the services but they always seem to be running a promotion.  This week is 5X reward points; I think.  

If you forget your in-the-mail coupon you're out of luck.  The in store circular doesn't have the coupon.  The Ulta app will not have the coupon.  So remember to bring the snail mail coupon.   I find the rewards program confusing but then again I only stop in once a quarter. 

They might be getting some new product lines because the shelves seemed picked over.  Many of the Ulta products seemed to be on clearance.

The new store is clean, it's well stocked and staffed.  It has the typical things you'd expect from an Ulta: A drugstore makeup selection that houses your typical brands - Maybeline, Revlon and CoveGirl as well as NYX ( which has become a very popular brand as of late) Sally Hansen for nails and other lesser brands like the Kardashians and Flower by Drew Barrymore.

Then you have the Posh side which contains the high end, expensive brands like: Too Faced, Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, Lipstick Queen and so many more.  There's the brow bar, where you can get your brows done by a brow specialist for $20(ish) dollars, and of course there are other things too.

In the center of the store is the perfume collection, all high end designer name perfumes as well as your celebrity perfumes are represented. Mostly newer perfumes, but they have quite the smelltacular perfume collection. 

And at the back of the store is the Nail section with your high end polishes, your hair care and your Hair Salon where they have the salon professional hair care and the Salon that is currently in operation.

I then called customer service to report all that had happened, and am still waiting for a call back from the District Manager.

I went there eager to make purchases and try some new cosmetics. I was willing to spend some big bucks! I was ignored and then when I asked an associate for a makeover to try the new products she went to the manager because she thought I wanted a free makeup session, but I only wanted to sample the products. I was perplexed because I have visited high end makeup counters in department stores all over the world and never had a makeup salesperson refuse to sample products on me so I could consider purchasing them. In fact, most makeup counters salespeople go overboard to have you sample the products. I never was treated so shabbily in my life at a makeup counter! 
Of course when i spoke up about this to the manager the salesperson then applied some makeup samples on my face but by then i had lost my enthusiasm for buying at that location. I think I was discriminated against because of my age (I am in my late 50's) They only seem to be nice to younger women. Stores should realize that it is us older women who have disposable income to spend and purchasing power.

I love walking into Ulta.  I love the smells, I enjoy the the display they always set up front, and I love the products.  I typically shop online, but today I wanted to go in the store to get some bronzer!  The store was clean, the products are always easy for me to find, and I was able to run in and out.

So why 2 stars out of 5?  I am so huge on customer service!  Sadly, my experience in this Ulta has never been positive.  After waiting in a line for 8 minutes an employee finally opened up a second register.  I walked up, she barely made eye contact with me.  I smiled, asked if I could use my coupon and she seemed annoyed that I spoke.

As she rang up my purchase I noticed (before I swiped my card) that the sale of Buy 2 get 1 Free items that I wanted did not come up as ""Free.""  I smiled, and asked her about it.  She didn't even look at me, and called the manager over.  The manager walked over and never acknowledged me, or even the associate.  She walked away to make sure the advertisement, of the sale, was on the shelf.  When she verified that it was she came over, clicked the register and took off the $8.00 of my purchase.

Now, easy fix right?  However, not once did either one of them speak to me.  There wasn't a, ""Oh goodness, let's fix this"" no ""thank you for letting us know"" not even eye contact!

GwEETO70j7mk5t9NDwEdDg,kZJs6j2VrWjNrtx_p2zpiw,1.0,"*update my stylist (Kiana) is no longer there so I won't be back.

I have a love hate relationship with this place. One of the stylist/managers picks and chooses what she wants to do and does not do up-dos. I booked Sandra for the Air Force ball because she was good the two times I had her. But when she didn't want to do the updo I needed and passed me off to someone else. Turns out she does this often. There has also been times when I booked another girl and without calling she switched my apts from the girl I booked for color to her. I understand the girls have things come up but to do that without calling. Anyways thank goodness for Kiana (that was the first time she was my life saver). Frankly if someone books you for an updo and you can't or won't do updos you shouldn't be in this line of work. That night I also noticed the way she treated the other stylists and even customers. I thought she was nice up until that night. I also think some of the younger stylists put up with more than They should. I was in the military and we were treated better than the way she treats them. It's easy to notice when you watch the eyes (she glared a lot and acted holier than thou) her interaction, tones, and body language said it all. Twice now I have had an apt and they were overbooked or surprise the girl I booked was MIA. They said they called but I looked and I had no missed calls and even showed the stylist my phone call history. 

I waited for Kiana because she's worth the wait. Online it books for 2 hours but only takes about 1 hour max for color. Bless her heart. She is super good and I hope she finds a better place to work that appreciates her along with some of the other girls. If I had to work under those conditions I would have found another place to work. Some of the girls are great but the manager  needs to get it together! Kiana 5 stars and the manager and salon manager 1 Star. I can't remember her name but there is a young stylist with dark hair and nose ring who is also good. She cut my hair once and I really like it. I keep coming back because of the few stylists I like but it's getting to the point where I can't stand how the business is run nor the way the managers treat the girls and with them not calling when there is a
Mishap. 

*****From what happened today and realizing I'm not the only one who was not contacted ....there were 2 other girls that came in claiming they were not contacted so I know damn well this manager and stylists didn't call and it confirmed the issues here. But yet the manager gets pissy if you can't make an apt.

*I would also price check products (the ceramic brushes can be found on amazon for over $10 less and most of the products I have found a lot cheaper on amazon) and services. It's around 40-50 just for a hair cut. I paid over 200 for a color that included highlights and a trim. I think the color is worth it but a trim costs too much here.",2018,TN,Tennessee,32.2052740942,-110.7870014684,Y,6

Hands down worst salon experience ever and I would literally rather do anything but a repeat of my interactions with the rude stylists. They talked to me like I was ignorant, kept talking to me like a child, saying ""right?"" after every sentence... told me initially that they wouldn't be able to complete the hair color I wanted in the three hour time slot. Okay, that's fine. I asked what else we could do, they said an all over color. Two mins later I was told there wasn't enough time for that. It was 6:20 and they are there until 9.

Joy just flat out did not want to help me and she literally knocked her arm into my shoulder and didn't even apologize. Not sure about you, but if I bump into a stranger on the street I'm apologizing. Why didn't I get the same courtesy as a client in her salon chair! It's because she didn't want to help me. She didn't talk to me at all, she didn't offer to show me my hair cut. Just handed me the barcode to pay and that's it. She kept making faces at the stylist next to her also. I thought I was at Ulta not in middle school. 

People generally leave a salon feeling better about themselves and having an enjoyable experience. That was not the case. I even confronted her about how she was treating me, both her and the mid 60s blonde lady. They kept throwing prices out there like it was an issue. Why would I have been there if I couldn't afford it? Both of them were offensive and should reevaluate whether or not they can provide the utmost level of respect and courtesy to their clients. Neither of them can. 

The point here is to stay far away from Joy. She will make sure you know she's better than you and that your presence in her salon chair is a bother to her. She will also tell you that she works two jobs and ""understands"" what it's like. Hahahaha I bet because she gets no tips at Ulta BECAUSE SHE IS TERRIBLE.

I had a hair appointment (first time in salon) which went pretty well. The stylist was sweet and suggested some product that she thought would help so I agreed. They were having a buy 2 get 1 free special and the stylist said they didn't have one of the products in stock. I told her that I wanted to take advantage of the special and she told me no problem, I could mix/match products and she handed me the 3rd product. 
When I went to check out is when my experience went downhill. 
The ""prestige manager"" was the person who checked me out. She interrupted my transaction twice to help others/and look for something and at no point did she excuse herself. When she gave me the total I asked her if she gave me the Ulta promotion that was going on as I bought $40 worth of Ulta. She looked in my bag, questioned if I had purchased enough and then said, "" oh okay, what color do you want?"" I told her and she took out the receipt, did something , and then I was done. I thought the total seemed a little high but I waited until home to check. When I got home I noticed I had something in my bag that wasn't mine, AND she hadn't given me the discount on the hair products. 
I grabbed the random product, receipt, and headed back to the store. She never apologized, she just ""returned"" a product that she had put in my bag (while helping other people) then proceeds to tell me that the hair product doesn't qualify for the discount.

A simple ""I'm sorry for the incorrect info and I'm sorry that you had to drive her a second time because WE made a mistake ""would have gone a long way.

The first visit was a bit overwhelming since I was shopping for a curling iron and they have at least twenty different kinds. I suppose I should've done my research but an employee offered help. I checked afterwards and her recommendations were legit on point. I was happy with my purchase and the price was more than reasonable. I used a coupon as well. 
 
They carry most of the shampoo and conditioners that I use and the prices are well below the salon. The Bare Minerals selection could use enhancement but they have the basics for when I'm in a rush and can't get to International.

She moved my appointment to the last slot of the day because she said it would take too long and she didn't want to mess up the schedules.

I don't think they even know the definition of a silk press, as I was coming in with my hair ALREADY blown out.

I recommend avoiding her if you can. She was incredibly unprofessional and hostile, attempting to instigate an argument with me over text. She must have a lot of time on her hands. Clearly business is slow.

The stylists do a decent job on your hair, but it comes at the cost of feeling marginalized and discriminated against for having a hair texture different than theirs.

I have purchased items from Ulta for a long time,  but I felt like I was being treated very poorly. This manager reluctantly returned my item and acted like she was doing me a major favor. I have sent many customers here and I have been a loyal customer myself. More importantly, when I turned away,  they were talking about me and it was very obvious.. At least have the decency to wait till the customer leaves the store. They just acted like a bunch of school girls and I'm very disappointed in that manager. Maybe Ulta needs to find another manager that doesn't promote gossiping about customers. VERY HURT THAT I WAS TREATED LIKE THIS!",2019,CA,California,28.20346675,-82.6678158669,Y,10

If the store wasn't brand new, nicely stocked, clean and organized I would give it zero stars.  I have been shopping at ulta for many years and it feels like every year the customer service continues to decline which is really unfortunate. Shopping for make up should be fun not frustrating but my frustration with Ulta is through the roof. I initially stopped at the citrus park location, and they were severely understaffed the one women on the floor was awesome she was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, the product I normally use wasn't available and I needed help finding a replacement and I had a few other questions so I tried to wait but after a while I decided to leave and go to another location, I remembered that a new location opened up not to far from us so I headed there. I walked in it was beautiful clean well organized and there were only 2 other customers yay!  I want to say there were about 4-5 girls standing around initially I was like perfect until I quickly realized as I was gathering the stuff I could on my own at no point did any one say hello or acknowledge my existence. I continued to walk around and grab stuff when I got to the point where I needed some assistance I realized I had been in the store for about 20 min with only a couple other people I looked at the associates 2 were in ""deep"" conversation with each other near the front the other 2 were chatting near the register with each other and 1 was putting stuff away. At that point I realized these girls don't give a shit they have customers in the store and maybe this ulta isn't the place either. I was standing in front of a display googling about a product and one of the girls walked right pass me normally they would ask if I needed help by the time I looked up she was some distance ahead of me At that point I decided in a situation like this you shouldn't have to chase down service at no point did anyone say hello or make eye contact. I decided to leave my bag and walked out. I guess it's time to see what the service is like at Sephora or Walmart lol.",2019,CA,California,28.20346675,-82.6678158669,Y,8
QT9e4KJSkhgtcoYKpnzpQw,u_bN8-vC8D7MvkI8RakP4Q,1.0,They have the most horrible stylist ever. I have pictures of before and after they gave me a bucket full of colors and covered the grey without coloring it I have been going to this place over a year and paying over 200.00 dollars each time except once when I had a hair treatment so livid and pursuing legal council.

She took the time to consult with me about the things that I liked about the photos that I brought. She was so kind and patient. I was so lucky to have her help me, because she has such a love for what she does. It's clear that she takes great pride and taking care of her clients and I am so thankful to have been one of those.

i48cHEyRBl5g9_npYIG7dA,u_bN8-vC8D7MvkI8RakP4Q,5.0,"I love ulta beauty store, they literally sell everything.

This place is like the Walmart for beauty products. It's double the size than Sephora, and sell a wide variety of cosmetic products.

You can buy make up bags, make up brushes, make up remover, so many kinds of skin care products and hair products. They have a mini salon in the back.

They also offer travel size products near the register, and you can always Google Ulta beauty store for a coupon.

I love this place I will go in for one thing and walk out with five. They sell blow dryer is flat iron curling iron's, body scrubs body lotions bath bombs, several brands of make up from high end to products that are affordable for everyone.",2019,CA,California,28.20346675,-82.6678158669,Y,9

I did a in store pick up for a Kylie Jenner lip gloss and when I came home to open it there was red lipstick all over the cap & it looked like it had been used.. why would you sell a used product to a customer & why wouldn't you double check?
