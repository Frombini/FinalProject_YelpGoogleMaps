vGMsqtn5CovrNzJZWfyC1w,idP674ti6a8yg8z2xFcCgA,1.0,third and final trip to this location  visited around christmas and was once again disappointed by the lack of staff and the attitude of the younger women that work there  i waited for someone to even look in my direction while i waited in the designated checkout location  out of the three cashiers  one was trying to help someone with a return the second one left the counter to help someone that had a question and the third cashier was nearest to me was on the phone trying to solve a customer issue  she reluctantly hung up from the call and waited on me never looked at me mumbled an apology for the wait all without ever making eye contact everstock is always low many shelves are bare and staff is scarce on the sales floorthe staff that is there looks like you are bothering them if you have a question  the ulta store in springfield is night and day different  plenty of helpful staffdone with this location ,1,2019,03:41:11,Y

my one complaint would be that i had a 245pm appt and my haircut wasnt started until almost an hour later the salon was pretty busy and tiffany had a handful of clients there for her i wasnt in a rush and had a book with me so i was fine to wait this time the ulta employees did a great job of checking in on me and making sure i didnt need anything which i appreciated i am hopeful that there will not be a wait next time

jaclyn is fantastic not only at curbing anxieties but at cutting hair my hair used to go down to the small of my back and i wanted to chop it to collar bone length i was terrified i had been growing my hair out for years but i was looking for a change

jaclyn gave me her advice and opinion based on the shape of my face and did a wonderful job cutting it with the layering style i like

a little later i went back i wanted to chop it again this time to the length of my chin coming in riddled with anxieties jaclyn helped calm me and decide the logistics of the cut she even remembered me similar to the first time i visited i loved my hair coming out

jaclyn not only cares about her clients but is extremely talented i will only be seeing her for my haircutting needs in the future",1,2020,16:55:59,Y

IIFsTrVUBjgjujSHIRyTiA,gNs9um_3hB3L8HFyMk2x4w,4.0,"ive been here three times fortunately for my pocketbook and schedule im not a makeup fanatic because this store has so much stuff i know some people probably go broke in here im going to try to stay away because i could easily get hooked

while there yesterday and the day before i saw so many different brands from so many different celebrities and people i learned about through youtube right alongside the brands that have been around for years there is something for everyone 

upon entering the store there were several people mulling around the front door i couldnt figure out what exactly was going on im guessing the store was having a party team meeting or maybe they just happened to be there at the time i entered im not sure if one of those many people greeted me or if they were even employees but as i made my way further into the store an associate asked whether or not i needed anything i declined and continued on the search for the specific product i had come for 

the shelf had a spot and price tag for the product id come for but there was nothing there there were similar products by the same manufacturer next to the empty spot so i decided to look for someone to assist me this turned out to be a small challenge i couldnt find anyone in that area of the store i walked around the general area trying to figure out who worked there and who didnt finally two ladies appeared about the same time at a counter in the rear of the store i asked if perhaps the product might be in the back and one of them went to check she returned with the last one in the store which was wonderful i returned to the front to check out  the line area has lots of last minute temptations but once again i was thankful that none of it interested me  there were two or three people checking customers out and one or two more doing different things in the register area ive concluded that getting customers out the door is not a number one priority here

although the store is well organized sections are clearly designated and lighting is perfect if employees had a uniform look a smock or if this huge store had little stations where customers could summons assistance it would be helpful for those of us who are not experts in beauty 

i ended up needing to return the item i purchased because i was not satisfied with it i looked online for ultas return policy and was delighted to find out that i would have no trouble getting a refund even though he item had been opened and used and could not be resold they have a very fair and accommodating return policy

the store has more than just make up it has curling irons blow dryers waxing kits lighted mirrors facial equipment the list goes on and on after returning home i received an email survey about my experience through the survey i learned that they offer services i had no idea but yeah they offer hair and skin services and even make up 

i will say it one more time  im so glad im not into make up because this store has way too much stuff and it looks like it could be fun",12,2019,14:41:23,Y

Ux0CsHDQvEbtZXlGDgcCHg,G4gzTUGV2xAoz6CG9STqfg,1.0,"872020  im actually surprised i havent heard from ulta since my review 

sadly since i initially posted my review ive been dealing with severe breakage pieces that are 2  3 long even after being forced to cut almost 3 off 

i get angry every time i look in the mirror  my hair is hideous looking and will be for months

and i resent that the salon manager said theyll use this experience as a learning opportunity for the stylist who ruined my hairreally that girl needs to go back to school her name is kimberly by the waydo not book with her unless its a simple cut or blow out 



warning  do not go to the hair salon there

i went to have some of my roots touched up i was blonde up until this incident about 2 weeks ago get a color gloss and a cut i had been doing my own hair for months and it was in good shape and condition before i walked into the salon 

i was assigned a stylist who i found out during my service that she had very little experience and wasnt yet 21which is why she didnt take what i was telling her about my hair seriously 

she bleached the roots but the bleach didnt take i mentioned that the product wasnt doing what it was supposed to but she said it was a selftimed product and would stop processing automatically fyi  the bleaching process didnt lighten my roots at all  but she left it on long enough to fry my hair pretty severely 

she rinsed out the product and went to prep the gloss shade i had asked for something more platinum vs yellow i also know a gloss needs to stay in the hair for at least 15 minutes less than 30 seconds after she applied it she was finding it out i jokingly said the color must be taking and she said yeah then i asked shouldnt this be on my hair longer her response was that since she saw the color depositing she could rinse it out

she then took me back to the chair and said she was going to trim my hair and even out the layers i specifically asked her not to take off any of the length or cut my bangs she barely cut any of my hair but what she did cut ended up looking like a mullet and because if her poor bleaching technique my hair has such extreme breakage  im losing so much hair every day and im getting depressed looking in the mirror everyday to see how badly she destroyed my hair 

i went back to my darker color a few days after my appointment because it will prevent me from having to color it as frequently vs when i was blonde 

i did call the salon the day after and spoke with the salon manager i let her know about all the issues and how bad my hair was the stylist took so much off from the top of my scalp area that it sticks straight up now i realize she was trying to hide the fact that my hair was breaking off so much from her poor technique

im giving 2 stars because they did without incident give me a full refund for the service 

but im utterly disgusted that now im spending just as much on deep conditioning treatments to minimize the amount of breakage 

ive had some good experiences with other ulta salons both here in nashville and in la but this is by far one if the worst salon experiences ive ever had 

id recommend going to a more established salon with technicians that actually have a good amount of",8,2020,22:34:12,Y

08L79P89GRdD6VpjzHeCsA,n66mhHJpXftCUW9vXqeZwQ,2.0,"this ulta is really really hard to love understaffed randomly restocked and not the greatest service i recommend browsing online or another local provider for their offerings rather than stopping in unless you know which specific product you want here

the cheaper side of ulta carries about 810 brands but its likely that a a fair number of those products are not well stocked i tried to find a brow pencil in brown and wasnt tied to any brand but it took looking through 5 separate brands to find a stocked selection the same has happened for concealers foundations and lip colors  you find the price point style and shade in a tester then you realize the product you want isnt actually available to buy and take home

some of my frustrations with this store are related to the brands not ultas setup but it goes handinhand for example its awesome to see a beautiful display of 10 lipsticks but then its likely that none of them are sealed and there are no designated test products to open and look at the colors most sections dont have a single tester meaning any of the unsealed products could have been swatched and its not fun thinking about buying a product someone else has already tested

when im at a beauty store like ulta i want to hear the wisdom of the makeup experts who work there and get their input but at this location i feel like you have to hunt them down and directly say i would like to spend x on y what should i get and the response and helpfulness has been widely varying most often leaning toward seeming inconvenienced this location always seems understaffed weather youre looking for specific products or youre waiting in their longggg line to check out

Ux0CsHDQvEbtZXlGDgcCHg,G4gzTUGV2xAoz6CG9STqfg,2.0,"warning  do not go to the hair salon there

i went to have some of my roots touched up i was blonde up until this incident about 2 weeks ago get a color gloss and a cut i had been doing my own hair for months and it was in good shape and condition before i walked into the salon 

i was assigned a stylist who i found out during my service that she had very little experience and wasnt yet 21which is why she didnt take what i was telling her about my hair seriously 

she bleached the roots but the bleach didnt take i mentioned that the product wasnt doing what it was supposed to but she said it was a selftimed product and would stop processing automatically fyi  the bleaching process didnt lighten my roots at all  but she left it on long enough to fry my hair pretty severely 

she rinsed out the product and went to prep the gloss shade i had asked for something more platinum vs yellow i also know a gloss needs to stay in the hair for at least 15 minutes less than 30 seconds after she applied it she was finding it out i jokingly said the color must be taking and she said yeah then i asked shouldnt this be on my hair longer her response was that since she saw the color depositing she could rinse it out

she then took me back to the chair and said she was going to trim my hair and even out the layers i specifically asked her not to take off any of the length or cut my bangs she barely cut any of my hair but what she did cut ended up looking like a mullet and because if her poor bleaching technique my hair has such extreme breakage  im losing so much hair every day and im getting depressed looking in the mirror everyday to see how badly she destroyed my hair 

i went back to my darker color a few days after my appointment because it will prevent me from having to color it as frequently vs when i was blonde 

i did call the salon the day after and spoke with the salon manager i let her know about all the issues and how bad my hair was the stylist took so much off from the top of my scalp area that it sticks straight up now i realize she was trying to hide the fact that my hair was breaking off so much from her poor technique

im giving 2 stars because they did without incident give me a full refund for the service 

but im utterly disgusted that now im spending just as much on deep conditioning treatments to minimize the amount of breakage 

ive had some good experiences with other ulta salons both here in nashville and in la but this is by far one if the worst salon experiences ive ever had 

id recommend going to a more established salon with technicians that actually have a good amount of experience",7,2020,20:27:06,Y

and thank goodness for salespeople like christina who are there to guide us all through the many bits of glamour this store has absolutely everything for pretty much every part of your body and from head to toe there is something for everyone

i actually went in with high hopes for finishing up my christmas shopping and got totally sidetracked with trying to find a signature scent for myself did i find one no    but after pretty much spritzing every part of my body with several different manly sprays i think i may have it narrowed down to less than a dozen choices

i was able to pretty much wrap up the rest of my christmas shopping right here and christina helped me keep focus as we looked at my list checked it twice and ended up finding way more that i had anticipated who knew that beauty products can be so much fun to learn about christina totally opened up my eyes and mind to specialty beauty products that i never knew existed

ulta has everything bodywash shampoos styling tools perfume makeupover the counter and higher end and so so so much morethis is why its a meander and not a pop in lol the staff at this ulta are amazing and always willing to help when needed but also happy to leave you to your own devices which is nice in my opinion  sometimes i like to try something new and being left to do that without a sales pitch makes it that much easier to do that but i know that if i have a product question they are there and ready  they also carry higher end makeup selections and usually have an expert for that brand in store so color matching and asking specific questions is a breeze 

overall i will always choose ulta for my products because the return policy is amazing  if you purchase a product and dont like it its not the right color its doesnt work well for you or u have a reaction to it return it even if you have used the product a couple times you can return it thats nice when you have sensitive skin and things dont always work for you

 brooke also called another store it see if they had the item i was looking for   made me so happy that you found it and its on hold for me  the manager  britney was very helpful and sweet as well as the other sales associates the store very clean the  product  displays  were nice we set up
the only problem that i have is that the lighting in the aisles of make up in the  register side of the store is very poor   it makes it hard to see the correct color of the product or to even use the testers if you are a make up person like me  you just find the lighted  mirrors on the other side of the store i often had to grab my items in go over to the lighted mirrors on the other side unfortunately this is a corporate issue and i hope that it is addressed this soon  cant wait to shop there again",2,2019,22:32:11,Y

v0ukNtkeHk_KtPSKOT_lSA,qPohxPukFHiTsQ5wFQa0FQ,1.0,"this is for the salon service i received on feb 2 i am pretty disappointed with how my experience went down

i arrived 6 minutes later from my scheduled appointment so my apologies for that all the stylists were busy with someone including the person that i had booked my appointment with of course that was no biggie thats how it can get in a salon and i was late for my appointment so simply i just had to wait theres a chair available to sit right next to the counter so thats where i settled several ladies asked me if i needed help or if ive been helped and i told them that i have an appointment with  at 2 so im just waiting for her to finish i waited an hour until she finished with her client and that didnt even bother me at all the one thing that put the icing on the cake for this whole thing was that by the time my stylist was finished and i am still sitting on the same chair i hear her coming and as shes printing out the receipt with her client as shes with another stylist at the computer the other lady tells my stylist this person never showed up and my stylist says ohh really well thats fine just cancel her she was a kind of a weird one anyway lets get so and so set up for her next appointment right then and there i wanted to get up and leave i couldnt believe what i just heard i guess they did not even know i was sitting right there after several seconds the other stylist asks me are you antoinette and i turned to her and said yes both of the ladies gasp and my stylist looks at me and says no way everyone was telling me that they you never showed up its ok i can take you right now i told them both i dont know why they would tell you that because several ladys came up to me and asked me what i was here for and ive been sitting here since 2 and even advised i was a bit late i wanted to tell her off and say that i dont know why you would still take me in anyway to do service if you just called me weird my birthday is the next day and i really wanted to get my hair done because its been way overdue and i was in a good mood so i just went in to get it done mind you ive seen this stylist before who cut my sons hair on christmas eve which i was so grateful for because all salons were closing early and she happened to be one that would wait out for me and that was still in to help anyone when i was calling around we had a really good conversation and i felt like i clicked with her to be comfortable so i definitely wanted to come back and even recommend her i still get my service done and she did an ok job we still talked away a storm of conversation but i didnt forget what happened i was just trying not to let it get to me because i am nice person and i didnt feel like causing a scene and i am a better person to step down to that level

cant be wrong i am a weird person but being unaware or being unprofessional at your work no matter what you think of someone id be careful with what you have to say and keep opinions outside of the work area i would point out the name of this stylist but i choose not to because the salon itself is just terrible with communication and its service so this review is not just for her but for everyone i just dont get when you have several ladies ask you if you need any help and then later they tell the other ladies that someone didnt show up when the person is waiting and then gets called by the stylist you are seeing that youre a weird one and basically saying that youre not liked and they dont even know youre around

so all over blonde on my roots but instead of going all the way to the scalp just use the brush to feather it in so when it grows out a little it wont look too bad sounds simple enough except cici was extremely confused she kept saying she could do highlights but that isnt what i wanted then she said she was going to get the manager so i waited for her to finish her other appointment while we were waiting she said that she didnt feel confident enough to be able to do my hair and maybe someone else should do it so that wasnt comforting at all 
then the manager came over and told me that what i was asking for was difficult and kept suggesting highlights and partial highlights and a balayage they wouldnt listen when i kept trying to say i didnt want those things i just wanted all the roots to be blonde but apparently they cant do that so i left without my hair down extremely frustrated and sad",1,2019,01:25:29,Y

 recently i visited the store again looking for a hardtofind item  the store didnt have what i was searching for  however a store employee i dont recall her name noticed me looking and offered to help  she confirmed they didnt sell the item  however using her cell phone she spent a few minutes locating the item at another store verifying it was instock and getting price info  needless to say this left me with a more favorable impression than my previous visit",2,2021,01:17:17,Y

q3REJnRgidfOushLTm83Kw,30rM6JGz_4cqjeBJZ93thA,4.0,"this is my local ulta and while i dont pop in here all the time its my goto for my shampoo and conditioner especially when they send me a coupon in the mail 

the store is pretty cramped but easy enough to navigate the salon is toward the back left and is always booming with customers everyone in there seems to be having a good time the floor associates are always courteous and quick to ask if i need any help and i mean really quick i know exactly where my shampoo is make a beeline for it then pull a sick 180 toward the cash register and they still manage to get a word in

the registers are my only problem with the store think of a homegoods or marshalls line of registers without the defined queue this results in customers who shall we say think less intuitively about queue flow and force the line down actual store aisles instead of snaking it around where it should go this could be easily solved by adding a ropedoff section specifically for the queue the store is so packed full of end caps and shelves anyway that removing something toward the registers would solve two problems at once

while i dont go to this store more than about twice a year its not an experience i dread they always have what im looking for and they deliver coupons semifrequently not a bad place to physically shop for beauty products in citrus park at all

as a sidenote one irking thing about ulta in general is that they press you for your phone number more than any other business ive been to they say its for returns but they can be very aggressive about it i just give them my moms phone number which they already have and she gets the points just so i can avoid the minor confrontation",7,2019,14:05:00,Y

minutes later the manager called and proceeded to tell me the system says my appointment was at  11am i told her i received 2 text message reminders yesterday for my appointment at 12pm  not 11am she told me i would need to send her a snip it of the texts because that is not what her system says my appointment is  i was appalled she was basically calling me a liar and asking for proof of the text messages i expressed this to her and she sarcastically said im sorry we can schedule you for another day she proceeded to say they were having system issues i responded how was that my issue and now i have to reschedule doing our whole conversation she spoke to me rudely i told her she needs customer service training  i asked to speak to her manager she said she was on vacation and she would send me her email just before she rudely commented have a nice day and hung up on me

jefrGYC2ZlQjbZ6xztD3-g,qDHInkhNalPHQi8rYi9kjA,1.0,"i went in for an appointment a little over a week ago with an elite stylist i felt really confident we were on the same page before she ever touched my hair we had a long conversation about what i wanted i had booked a full highlight and a cut i wanted to bring up the color of my 2yearold ombre into a warm balayage which was listed under the highlight service she asked how blonde so i showed her a picture of the exact balayage i wanted she said that had been exactly what she had in mind and we talked about how nice it would be for fall 

i said i wanted to take off 23 inches with a max of 3 inches coming from the bottom because the hair was pretty broken and dead she said she could definitely do that and asked how i like to style my hair daytoday i said i love throwing it into a messy bun at home curling it or straightening it for work and sometimes just wearing it naturally curly by tossing it over one side of my head i said i wanted layers cut back in because most had grown out she had cut my hair before and it was nice so there were no red flags yet

back to the color she said how good long choppy layers would look with the balayage i was going for i had no reason to doubt that i wasnt going to get what i asked forshe went on and on about how good it was going to look once the color in my hair was refreshed

when she took the foils out at the sink she commented about how wonderfully my hair had lightened up it hadnt been colored in nearly two years so i knew it shouldve worked well since the dye was mostly on virgin hair but then she said she wanted to make the color pop more and would i be okay with her deepening the root with a little bit of dye i trusted that she knew what she was doing so i said it was fine i thought maybe she had brought the balayage up a little too far and needed to touch it up to shadow the roots a bit i stayed in the sink for another half hour while that dye set and then we went back to the chair

i was confused in the chair because even though my hair was wet i couldnt see any signs of color i thought i shouldve been able to see some of the warm blonde at the bottom but there wasnt anything to be seen its okay though i thought because ive colored my full head and barely been able to tell when it was wet id wait until it was dry before making a judgment

i didnt have any doubt about her ability to cut my hair because ive been to her for a cut before so when she came to the side and showed me where she intended to start cuttingabout three inches from the bottomi wasnt concerned until she was still trimming off bits from the bottom 20 minutes later and i realized my hair had lost nearly six inches i started to panic a little bit but wanted to wait until she was finished 

maybe the layers would redeem it and it would be fine hair grows back right maybe wed had a miscommunication about the length i didnt know it at the time ended up taking off all of my remaining ombre i dont know how she interpreted i want to bring this color up since ill lose some of it in the trim into take all of this color off but once she had dried my hair i was shocked to see that not only had she taken six inches off but it was also all one length no layers to be seen 

and the color no slow gradual transition from warm blonde to my natural dark brown just cool blonde highlights from top to bottom throughout my entire head and as i later realized the highlights arent evenly spaced and some have missing brown chunks where the brown dye was unevenly layered over the blonde during the shadow root touchup

i wondered if it was the salon lighting that was making me see things i let her finish styling it as she gushed about how its still long even though it was barely touching my shoulders when it had formerly gone halfway down my back i stupidly paid   tip for this absolute destruction of my hair

lets recap

i asked for
 a warm blonde balayage
 a maximum of 3 cut off the length
 layers

i got
 cooltoned roottotip highlights
 darker roots on formerly virgin hair which will now be difficult to color over
 a minimum of six inches off of my hair which will take over a year to grow back
 an allonelength cut

was it opposite day because i feel like i somehow came out on the other side of the cupboard in narnia with a bad haircut

the salon manager contacted me offering to fix it and told me if i couldnt get there in one to two weeks im from out of town she could give me 20 off my next service i thought about going back but ultimately decided it would be better to go somewhere else rather than risk it getting even worse 

i asked ulta for a partial refund for this nightmare but havent heard back im not holding my breath

misinformed i actually thought it was nice of her to cover for her coworker she then proceeded to go in the back and then she came back with exactly what i needed the girl working in front of the mac products just didnt want to take any time helping i guess but to the lovely lady who helped thank you i believe her name is sherleigh or something close to that im so

i knew better but it shouldnt be this way i need a forever hair stylist that doesnt want my soul to make my hair look good i called in good faith and asked for a color specialist they all say they are and that its their favorite part of styling   anyhow emily assured me that their newest stylist katie was a color correction specialist and she wasnt new to de industry well 3 years isnt what i call specialist level specially because im pregnant and she obviously used the wrong volume to do the processing of my hair and left patches everywhere she still uses the board and she dropped it a few too many times on the floor that i felt bad for all of them its funny how i was joking with her that i hated 2000s chunks of hair that was called highlights just to make sure she used a fine technique when grabbing my highlights wishful thinking my appointment was at 1 but i was running 15 mins late but it didnt matter because i had to wait for my stylist to be done with her previous appointment for another 30 mins thats 45 mins i would of have to wait if i wouldnt have been late i told her time was an issue but i wasnt done until 530 and unhappy i told her i was for sure calling back color was super ashy with the outside light and she chopped my hair off not really a real hair cut where she would of have noticed the shorter side on it nice girl but need to really practice and listen to her clients and if she cant deliver is best to say so no shame on that trust me 

mistake 2 going back to fix it 7 years and i dont know why she did what she did your hair looked better with the 1st mistake  my husbands words and he is the one that tells me i look amazing even if im wearing a trash bag so yeah amber removed the toner katie put on barley blended the patchy places and threw another toner that gave me a color if katy griffins hair had a baby with a mm she also fixed the cut by using some special technique well tell that to the ponytail lol see pic lol

i will say they were very polite and willing to try to fix the mistake and never changed their attitude to an ugly unpleasant experience 

oh well at least my husband got a kick at the pinterest vs reality moment of my life until i told him i paid 220 not so funny then save your money girls go to the schools to get this quality seriously

this ulta has been going downhill for a while its always messy and unorganized theres bins left on the floor in the aisles the employees on the floor are rude and will point out flaws in your makeup its not clean or well kept the employees seem miserable and theyre always out of stock of popular items me and my mom had a terrible experience at the hair salon in particular
last year we went to get our hair done here because weve always liked buying makeup at ulta and figured we would have a good experience i wanted ombr with platinum ends my hair was chocolate brown my hairdresser explained to me she wouldnt be able to get my ends all the way to platinum in one sitting and that id have to come back probably one more time i didnt know anything about bleaching hair at the time but i was okay with it and wanted her to do what she could to get it as blonde as possible my senior pictures were the next day so i still wanted it to look nice she asked me if i wanted a solid ombr or this choppy style ombr she had done on other clients i specifically said solid ombr and had a reference picture i ended up with an orangey gold unblended i dont even know what to call it i think she tried to do the choppy style ombr with streaks that she had done on other clients when i specifically asked for solid ombr it looked terrible there was a line between the brown and the orangey gold there were parts that were so patchy they looked like hot topic patterned hair extensions i even showed my hairdresser as she was leaving and she acted like she didnt see anything my moms hairdresser saw how bad of a job mine did and ended up blending some parts more with toner for me because my hairdresser left i dont know what my hairdresser used on my hair but it didnt look good at all ive seen good hairdressers take brown hair to platinum in one sitting a few years back i had the same thing done at fantastic sams in sun city and they got my ends to platinum without major damage and the ombr was nicely blended it was much cheaper than ulta which ended up being about 200 each for me and my mom my hairdresser at ulta could have at least blended it nicely and toned it right
my mom had a bad experience too she wanted a balayage and had dark brown almost black hair her hairdresser claimed to be the best colorist at the salon she ended up taking forever on my mom because she had to strip the box color first then work on the balayage she took on another client about halfway through and worked on them both at the same time which was a problem she was rushing on my moms hair and we didnt end up leaving until after 900 at night started around 400 she wouldnt even style her hair at the end my mom had to style it herself and this other hairstylist gave her an attitude when she asked for some hairspray my mom ended up with red and orange streaks on the back of her head needless to say when we walked out of there we were not happy
we talked to the manager about the situation afterwards and she wouldnt refund us instead she offered to fix our hair for free on another day when she did my hair she was really nice and apologetic about it but i dont think she even did anything but tone my hair because it looked the same just gray and the ombr wasnt fixed my ends eventually faded back to that orangey gold color a week later my moms hair looked the same too just slightly less orange

second appointment i decided i wanted to color my hair and get some highlights along with a minor color correction the full color is fine but the highlights are thick like britney spears from he early 2000s and are warm toned when i obviously have cool toned skin the picture i showed her is very subtle cool toned highlights which she said she could do i paid 200 for this and am very unhappy with the result i should mention that she was also very rough on my scalp

i mentioned i was swatching before on my own turns out this is quite difficult because the stations are poorly stocked with makeup remover and alcohol and each station is completely different and random one had a spray bottle of alcohol brush cleaner and hand sanitizer another had a jumbo hand sanitizer bottle and another had a spray bottle of water not sure when i would use water alone but hey was also difficult to find trash cans around the store to throw away the applicators used for testing

1xFpt3S7c-8wkE18oG6QqA,b9bwm23B7_nOQ0UNW1NGkQ,3.0,"this review will be based on a service i received here today made an appointment for a 60 minute customized facial ive never gotten a facial before and pricing was reasonable here 

my appointment was for 1215pm by the time we got started it was 1225pm my estheticians name was aaryn she confirmed i was getting a 60 minute service i was asked to fill out a form regarding my overall health and skin type aaryn made small talk in the beginning and discussed my top 3 skin concerns with me she descended the chair to the lowest position told me to get comfortable and put a blanket over top of me it was cozy 

what i didnt like about this experience was that aaryn didnt go over any of the products she used on my face she couldve put anything on my face and i wouldnt know because nothing was said 
another pet peeve was the fact that she kept getting up and walking away shed leave me in the chair with the product on my face and go elsewhere she turned on a machine that released steam and i felt the heat and steam mist onto my cheeks 

when she was done the facial it was 1259pm definitely not 60 minutes i felt like i got ripped off because she was in a rush to finish the service one of my concerns was redness in my cheeks she handed me a mirror to show me the finished look and i felt like i had more redness than i did when i first got there i asked her about a cool tingling sensation in my face and she explained that it was an exfoliating product she used that could be causing the feeling 

went up to the cashier to pay and aaryn was nowhere to be found she didnt go over any aftercare with me and i had to leave her tip in an envelope with another employee it was kind of unprofessional 

25 stars for this subpar service probably wouldnt get another facial here but will still stop by to purchase makeup",4,2019,00:55:27,Y

i told her what i wanted and she mentioned the colors she recommended and then  she lead me to dermablend and matched me perfectly this has been my holy grail also stephanie was so nice and talked to me through the whole process and gave me tips and other products she has been the main reason i continue to keep going to ulta most of these beauty stores i hardly get great service but this was the best so far",6,2019,23:41:47,Y

today was different in that a very nice and intimidatingly pretty woman came up to me as she saw me searching the shelf and asked if i needed help i mentioned my issue of not being able to find my foundation shade on my previous two visits and she was beyond helpful she looked and when she also didnt find it she offered to have it ordered and shipped to my house and went further to offer to grab me a sample of the foundation so i would have some in the time it took to arrive

i am expressing my disappointment with the keratin treatment i underwent in december at the dale mabry branch 
this was my first visit and perhaps the last visit to an ulta salon
i have done the keratin treatment thrice before tying it out at your salon
hence very familiar with the process and the after results my hair being dry and frizzy shows fantastic results post keratin and it lasts for as long as good 4 months but this time its as good as i didnt get a keratin done
my hair is just the same as before i spent around 200 keratinhaircut and it was for nothing i can walk in today and show it to you but i know it would not change anything for me 
while undergoing the treatment i did noticed the difference in the process itself but i thought why not wait for the results and then decide
results  neither softer nor manageable hair looks frizzy and dry just as before its been a month to the treatment and everyday i look at my hair i feel cheated 
i walked out of the salon unsure and confused as days passed i realized what a blunder it was
absolute no value for money i came to you for the keratin thinking that your a brand and could be trusted i guess not 
you should be sorry for the kind of service you give people for a 200 bill
sorry ulta your are just not worth my money

i should have known it wasnt a great location when i walked in past 3 employees and was not acknowledged in any way 
as i walked around shopping i found an iphone on a lower level shelf next to products 

i picked it up and immediately walked up front to give to a clerk i stood at the side where you can pick up online orders and patiently waited two women at the register one working and one seemed to be organizing both made eye contact but said nothing as the one organizing walked past me to leave the register area still saying nothing i spoke up rudely she asked if i was picking something up i stated that i was not however i had found a customers phone and wanted to give to someone she grabs it and says its not a customer phone but an employee i know who it belongs to as she rolls her eyes and walks off hastily 
the other young lady shrugs and goes back to what shes doing

how do you spell worst customer ever 
carmen
went in with my mom today to treat her to some nice perfume and dr brandt s eye depuffer
we were pointed to the back of the store 
we were clearly looking around as 2 women talked amongst themselves both obviously spotting usboth ignored us completely  guess the conversation was more important  stood there for about 20 seconds while they talked and then finally walked up and ventured to askthe one girl finally helped us and was pretty nice this carmen chick  as her name tag pronounced turned on her heels and arrogantly clicked away 

fast forward to me purchasing said items for mom at register and more clueless looks from mindless automatons  my mom asked nicely if they possibly had any samples you would have thought she had asked for their first born child

rude rude rude 

fast forward yet another time in the same day because i had sprayed a perfume i loved and wanted to return and buy it and figure out what it was 

walked past the counter where not 1 but four to five sales associates were congregating and shooting the breeze i was about 2 feet from them for at least 5 minutes obviously looking for something and still not one of them asked if i needed help 

ask again same girl  carmen rudely turns on her heels while same sweet girl wearing a head scarf  and another associate help me


see carmen blandly poised at the register where she looks severely put out that she has to deign to lazily ring someone up

i asked the girls who were helping me 
is that your manager  knowing that sometimes the manager will have better things to do than answer questions not really  and defer to the associates 

nope  not a manager  just a brat 

and to top it off the whole back of the store is a hot mess and jumble of racks that need to be re shelved

wonder if these girls could be doing something useful 

i will return because its right by my office  but not for the awful and rude customer service

 my sister and i brought our mother here for a full makeup makeover as a birthday gift we were hoping for a mua who could give a brief tutorial so we coud purchase all the products and she can do it later herself

 upon entering the store we were told to go upstairs to check in  we were rudely spoken to by a hairstylist who didnt even look up when we asked to check in and just curtly said go downstairs we told her we were sent upstairs and she screamed for another woman to come help us who happened to be sitting in the corner just watching not even attempting to help  she then denies we have an appointment until we show her confirmation and she just goes oh your right here  makeup artist was completely unprepared for us

this doesnt seem that bad but when your mom gets all dressed up and excited for  a rare moment of pampering   it just started the experience off on a bad foot oh but wait


finally she is seated for her makeup the girl is nice but honestly it doesnt make up for the rest of the s show

1 the makeup area is by what looks like the workers break area thats fine but its not fine when there what looks like day old chinese food and trash everywhere i added a picture
2 she applied moisturizer and primer with her fingers ewww and i didnt see her wash her hands immediately before again my mother is being pampered im not going to interupt and make her feel grossed out  she used brushes from a big tuberware container full of makeup and other things for the rest of the appointment which is again unsanitary
3  the originally rude hairdress proceeds to chomp on doritos about two feet away from my mom getting her makeup done and just watches  in what world is this not annoying and bizarre then washed her hands without soap  and went back to the girl whos hair she was coloring 
4  a random customer came up out of nowhere and started asking questions and the makeup artist left my mom sitting there for 10 minutes while she went to help herwhere are the other workers  it was a saturday evening 

overall her make up looked ok  nothing i couldnt do myself but its extremely frustrating that they got 300 from us again for the sake of my mom and her gift we didnt raise hell  my sweet mom tipped her and the makeup job was 45 dollars plus the product that we bought

well i shouldve paid attention to that statement the 3rd time i came to get my hair done because sarah ignored my requests and went for her own vision of me as a grayhaired woman first she used foils when i wanted balayage to give a few strategically placed highlights the foils added a tremendous amount of highlight in areas i didnt want anymore and no root color next she used a toner that was darker and grayer than the last so i looked ancient i was very unhappy and said i never asked to be made a grayhair im middleaged but she made me look elderly who ever says to their stylist please make me look older 

the coup de gras was they called me and said that since i was unhappy with their work 2 out of 3 times they didnt want me back as a clientsay what instead of trying to fix the issue they blamed me they blamed me for their incompetence the manager never once apologized for what happened or how i was treated they returned the last money i paid but kept the tip which earns them the single star 

i went to sallys right after that phone call and bought everything i needed to fix my hair roots dyed to the proper color added a few balayage highlights and got a bright white toner and it looks fabulous i look 20 years younger and i got exactly what i wanted i even cut my own hair saving 260month  tip d",6,2019,02:10:08,Y

then the store associate directed me to a morphe palette iv heard of this brand but i dont know much about it besides jefferee star talks about it on his little channel so i said ok the colors in this palette are nice and wow its so cheap i wonder why but thinking oh its ulta they have good products even if its on the side cheap side of the store i take it home not thinking to even look at the ingredients or where its made today i flipped it over and i found out its made in china no wonder why its so cheap these products everyone rave about contain some not so nice ingredients in them that can harm you down the road not to mention its not cruelty free especially coming from china 

hey ulta get it together and train your staff better when someone comes in looking to spend at least 100150 on new product and the store associate points me to the 12 product talking about how great this brand is no thanks",10,2019,11:17:02,Y

went in with my mom today to treat her to some nice perfume and dr brandt s eye depuffer
we were pointed to the back of the store 
we were clearly looking around as 2 women talked amongst themselves both obviously spotting usboth ignored us completely  guess the conversation was more important  stood there for about 20 seconds while they talked and then finally walked up and ventured to askthe one girl finally helped us and was pretty nice this carmen chick  as her name tag pronounced turned on her heels and arrogantly clicked away 

fast forward to me purchasing said items for mom at register and more clueless looks from mindless automatons  my mom asked nicely if they possibly had any samples you would have thought she had asked for their first born child

rude rude rude 

fast forward yet another time in the same day because i had sprayed a perfume i loved and wanted to return and buy it and figure out what it was 

walked past the counter where not 1 but four to five sales associates were congregating and shooting the breeze i was about 2 feet from them for at least 5 minutes obviously looking for something and still not one of them asked if i needed help 

ask again same girl  carmen rudely turns on her heels while same sweet girl wearing a head scarf  and another associate help me


see carmen blandly poised at the register where she looks severely put out that she has to deign to lazily ring someone up

i asked the girls who were helping me 
is that your manager  knowing that sometimes the manager will have better things to do than answer questions not really  and defer to the associates 

nope  not a manager  just a brat 

and to top it off the whole back of the store is a hot mess and jumble of racks that need to be re shelved

wonder if these girls could be doing something useful

i have been getting my brows done relatively consistently for almost 10 years now thats 10 years in 4 different cities nobody has ever come close to giving me brows like sierra at seminole benefit brow bar does 

sierra in particular is wicked talented at what she does and shes as kind as could possibly be she has become one of my favorite people and to think i only even see her a few times a year all the benefit brow girls here takes the time to consult with you before even touching your skin to make sure they know exactly the look you want to achieve they also discusses skin sensitivitiesallergies etc very thoroughly before any hair comes off your face they will map out with eyeliner so you know exactly what is going to come off this means you will never experience the tragedy of leaving a salon with skinny little over waxed brows amen 

the process is very efficient if im not in too chatty of a mood i can get in and out in under 15 minutes easily they also will do your brow makeup and concealer after the treatment completely complimentary i usually like to let my skin breathe after a wax and therefore decline this offer but for those instances when i still have reasons to keep my face on its brilliant i feel confident carrying out my day knowing that nobody would ever know i just had little hairs ripped off my face",1,2020,13:14:52,Y

now  they publicly let people know that they welcome walk ins and that is how i have always had my brows done just by walking in at different times of the day a woman comes from behind the counter and mildly seems annoyed but i understand she works retail and the next 72 hours are about to be insane instead of her being polite or even seeming like she wants to help me  she flips through a book on the brow bar and says yeah i dont have a single thing til 740 or 8 pm okay lets be realistic its not even 5 pm i literally said ah im sorry i drove 30 minutes across town to come here and i cant wait until 8 pm i asked her about waiting for a bit if the esthetician was at lunch or something and that i didnt mind to wait a bit she did told me no not until those two times only now when you have a specific service you offer wouldnt it be smart to have someone able to provide that service during your open hours and not at the very end of the night i am frustrated because she was not friendly and seemed annoyed that i was just trying to pay for a service i get all the time

lets play a game of 2 truths and a lie 

1 i am a natural blonde
2 i do not own a hair straightener 
3 i have never cried in a salon 

until recently all of these were true however thanks to the remarkablesensationalinfectiously gregariousnot to mention gorgeous senior stylist and redkin certified colorist christin 

for the first time i treated myself to a real salon experience i get the hype and also i dont know if i can live any other way ever again christin worked quickly and kept me entertained which made the fact that i was sitting there for like a bajillion hours less painful literally something i didnt even think about until i experienced it was just how fun it was to be able to peruse and shop while the foils sat in my hair ulta is a magical land of glitter and smells and fun how can you not have an amazing time exploring 

i got a the double vip experience christin colored cut and styled me and salon manager bridgette did my wash massage and blow out i was facing away from the mirror during my blow out and couldnt see the color result until the end the oohs and ahs from the gals working as well as my ever doting and loving mother made me feel like an absolute movie star when she spun me around it was confirmed i had movie star hair this is when the tears started i was crying in a salon 

this experience was 5 stars and then some it came at a price and it was lengthy but it was worth it it was so worth it 

i appreciated the attention to detail the customer care and the quality of services i also am thrilled to report that the approach to safety during this time is top notch masks gloves social distancing its all happening 

do you wanna play another game of 2 truths and a lie

now lets get to the store itself i thought this was a decent sized ulta and also it is in a very convenient location the items are not neatly organized though there is stuff lying everywhere clearance sections are a total mess if you have a lot of time to kill and like to search for stuff yes please go to this ulta if not better stay away from it",2,2019,00:22:56,Y

this review is specific to my experience with the stylist named helgada  this review is not about the store

not sure what prior experience helgada has but her skills are too bad even for great clips  doesnt listen to client request at all  

i told her i specifically do not use a straightener on my hair and she looked at me like i have 5 heads  if you know how to blow dry hair properly then theres no need to use a flat iron to reduce frizz 

i  asked multiple times for a concentrator to be used on the hair dryer she told my multiple times its not needed and that ill see once shes done  finally she tells me she doesnt have a concentrator because she doesnt use them  

i dont know any legit hair stylist who uses a round brush to comb out dry hair  are you trying to damage my hair no im not talking while hair is being dried im talking about when hair has been dried then running a round brush down it from roots to ends ike rapunzel combing her hair  

icing on the cake was finally me asking her for the hair dryer and brush to fix it  she wanted to know what exactly i didnt like about it  nicest way i could put it was all of it  so i finally trying to fix it myself to look halfway decent  she then rushed to the register to print out my bill

ended up tying it back into a bun since it was just too pathetic to walk out with  45 for really just a wash since i did the styling myself

she told me that i could get my hair done by someone else i couldnt find time to make another appointment so i went with the other stylist i went in for a trim and ended up having to pay 45 for it that just is not right

the managers name was catalina gomez 
i politely asked the manager catalina if she can accommodate me by giving me 10 off on my clarins face masque i wanted to purchase she disregarded that fact that the item was in filthy and dirty condition and she sold me a dirty looking face clarins after she looked at it and said no to my request 
so i didnt know that ulta beauty despite the company name sold and sells dirty looking items to customers and would not even clean off the packaging at least for me to make me feel like at least she did something about my item i wanted to purchase and helped me out with my experience in the store which she totally didnt even do

i called a month in advance to schedule an appointment for a hair donation and i asked the lady on the phone whose name i unfortunately cant remember if my haircut would be free as many hair salons do free haircuts when customers donate their hair i also asked if ulta would ship my hair to donation organizations i was told yes and yes one month later i came to ulta unprepared to pay for a haircut but i kept five dollars cash in my pocket to tip my stylist 

when the stylist cut my hair she didnt use my natural part in fact she didnt use much of a part at all my hairs new natural part is a crooked middlepartgonewayward part and i have not used it since because of how poor it looks after cutting my hair the stylist washed my hair did some more trimming with the same part and then sprayed a few things in she tried to blow out my hair but i told her i dont like heat

i nearly left the ulta but was then handed a 70 bill with a 20 firsttime discount and a plastic bag with my hair to donate i had to send it out myself 30 minutes of time and zero styling does not cost 70 also i was told on the phone that my cut and the shipping of my hair would be taken care of 

i talked to the manager and she eventually lowered the price to 30 she said that i misheard the woman on the phone and that the woman on the phone must have meant that ulta will ship out my hair for free oddly enough ulta was not shipping out my hair for free anyway so the managers refutation was nonsensical when i asked about adding the 20 firsttime discount to the 30 fee the manager said that going from a 70 cut to a 30 cut was my discount that is not a discount that is me paying the appropriate amount for the cut i received 

i paid for the cut and i kept the cash i set aside for a tip in my pocket one could say that just like how a 30 cut was my discount a 30 cut was a tip i will not be returning to ulta for any beauty needs whatsoever the customer service is ridiculously horrible practically nonexistent",11,2019,05:31:40,Y

on the first trip was in the morning i was going in for a new shampoo and conditioner combo i was about to run out of the kenra that i use and wanted to try something new i wanted to go for something either vegetarian or vegan im trying to cut back on harsh chemicals on my skinbody i was in the store in the hair section for about 20 mins no one ever greeted me and there was no one to help me i ended up getting frustrated and leaving without purchasing because i wasnt helped at all 

then the second trip was mid day at about 2pm i went in for makeup wipes and a new cleanser again something either vegetarian or vegan i walked in and there were about 5 girls gossiping about one lifted her head and said hello then went back to their convo i found my makeup wipes and was roaming around the non elite brands and the elite brands every single employee was gossiping giggling and not paying attention to the many customers that were roaming around with a blank confused looks on their faces myself being one of them 

i know a lot about makeup and both times i went without a beat face and my hair up im not sure if they are profiling women that already have makeup on or if i just caught bad timing however i have never been treated like this in any other ulta stores other ulta stores are nice friendly and helpful not looking like a bunch of cliques of girls",4,2019,18:50:25,Y

the decor is very welcoming extremely bright and cheery i can see how this place would be popular with the guys and gals who enjoy this type of thing i came in to buy some stuff for a costume party 

what i am interested in is cleanliness organization and customer service i have to say that this place was lacking in all three the shelves were disorganized some of the makeup samples were mixed in with others and the prices were wrong 

then you have the customer service in the 20 minutes i was there i saw 3 staff people two of whom were idly chatting amidst the aisles and one who was minding the store

of course when i spoke up about this to the manager the salesperson then applied some makeup samples on my face but by then i had lost my enthusiasm for buying at that location i think i was discriminated against because of my age i am in my late 50s they only seem to be nice to younger women stores should realize that it is us older women who have disposable income to spend and purchasing power

dNVtVBw7O50yjbsx9NNGgQ,652tRAf14Mu-2kzPKCeMbQ,1.0,its been about 1 month since i got my hair cut by a pro at ulta in new orleans i was waiting to write this review to see if ulta would contact me back because i have not heard from them i am writing this review it was 1 week before my big birthday and i went in for a trim all around including my long bangs the pro stylist did not  ask me how i wanted it and then i decided to tell her what i was there for and as i always get the same length i asked for my bangs to flare out with the shortest length below my cheek bone when the stylist turned me around towards the mirror i see my bangs a pinch amount of bangs 1 inch away from my hairline i of course flipped out by what i saw and was outraged because i was having a birthday celebration in a week and was left with just a pinch of hair right in the middle of my front hairline which did not blend into anything my hair literally was sticking out like a little girl cutting her own hair the stylist by the name of cc stated to me im sorry i was not able to see where you were pointing because of your mask im sorry but me pointing to where i wanted the length had nothing to do with my mask because im pointing in the same place with or without the mask its still on the same place i sure did not point onto my forehead i can say this was the worst experience i ever had with ulta and i will not go back there again for any services please be advices about their cervices and know if you get a pro it necessary wont be one,8,2020,02:13:07,Y
ocSJdWHv-LfBgc368labRA,DLV4zM60EdyPFafEk88crg,2.0,"this review is on the retail store and not the hair services or beauty services in the rear

i love walking into ulta  i love the smells i enjoy the the display they always set up front and i love the products  i typically shop online but today i wanted to go in the store to get some bronzer  the store was clean the products are always easy for me to find and i was able to run in and out

so why 2 stars out of 5  i am so huge on customer service  sadly my experience in this ulta has never been positive  after waiting in a line for 8 minutes an employee finally opened up a second register  i walked up she barely made eye contact with me  i smiled asked if i could use my coupon and she seemed annoyed that i spoke

as she rang up my purchase i noticed before i swiped my card that the sale of buy 2 get 1 free items that i wanted did not come up as free  i smiled and asked her about it  she didnt even look at me and called the manager over  the manager walked over and never acknowledged me or even the associate  she walked away to make sure the advertisement of the sale was on the shelf  when she verified that it was she came over clicked the register and took off the 800 of my purchase

now easy fix right  however not once did either one of them speak to me  there wasnt a oh goodness lets fix this no thank you for letting us know not even eye contact  i walked out thinking to myself holy smokes they must hate their job",10,2019,13:47:18,Y

ZZC0hv6mqPvd5iVtG3ahFg,TPUFZpI2RWEgJjOmLFtvCA,1.0,"we went in this weekend to get a style for my daughter she was having some photos taken and her hair it so so straight we can barely do anything with it first of all we hen we got there the woman said she was an hour behind and that we could reschedule not possible so she said she would do her when the other client had her dye in i really appreciated that so we waited all we wanted was her hair turned under and told her that my daughters had would not do it without a lot of work and a good amount of product 

   the stylist could not understand that we wanted the hair smooth with just the bottom turned under we got up a picture of when it had been done that way before she proceeded to spray the tiniest amount of heat set in and blow dry it under while telling my daughter that her hair was cut wrong and she could do this herself easily if her hair was cut correctly her hair was cut two weeks ago and had lasted all day so we go to leave and her hair is already popping out i did not leave a tip

this is not the first time we have dealt with weird stylists here once when my daughter was ten we got a trim and afterwords when i asked her how it was she started crying because the woman had kept snapping at her when she shifted and blamed my daughter for her hair being crooked because at one point she had crossed her legs of course its good to give direction but this kid has been having her hair styled professionally since she was little and knows the drill all you gotta do it remind her",8,2021,17:29:59,Y

dGqPTJ3VSq6DzxsqTMpbhg,TPUFZpI2RWEgJjOmLFtvCA,1.0,"i went in to the store yesterday and took my sweet time browsing through sections as this was my only break from being home with my kids 
i noticed that the larger woman with short hair who had greeted me at the front door was inconspicuously im sure she was hoping she was following me from department to department first through the make up aisle then the hair section i actually stopped in the hair section and started asking her about straightening products they offered she was very helpful with showing me a few items 

i usually get my hair products from aveda salons where i get my hair done so im actually rather skeptical of anything they had to offer 

i then started browsing the skin aisles which are on the complete opposite side of the hair section and the larger lady with short hair seemed to find her way there too i didnt say anything because i had nothing to hide but its a horrible way to feel as a customer 

im actually a licensed esthetician who has worked at miraval massage envy and european wax center in the past and am used to much more expensive products than what was offered ulta i was here because i was completely out of face wash and moisturizer at home and instead of ordering my usual products online and waiting for shipping i would just rather go buy something i had used clinique as a teenager and my mother sold lancme as well and i knew ulta had some of their items 

i went to pay for my items and low and behold the larger woman followed me there and even had another worker come around from behind the counter while i was paying for my items to see if i had stolen anything there like i said i didnt say anything because i had nothing to hide but the entire experience was an embarrassment for everyone involved 

now i walked in wearing a 200 coach purse my 300 lucky brand eye glasses my tommy hilfiger sandals and was not dressed down the only  thing i could think of that could have made me look suspicious depending on the level of intellect the person had that was judging me was that i was black there were plenty of other people walking around the store but i was the only person being followed 

i will never shop here again i may as well have gone to a walgreens in the hood",7,2020,14:32:56,Y

TTKqTUrhDfmtlKd-LiqogA,THOXisAF58kiwXUv0h-w3g,1.0,"if you have curly or multiethnic hair consider going somewhere else to get your hair done they are not respectful or inclusive i have curly hair and made an appointment online to get it straightened i texted the stylist a picture of my hair blown out to tell her thats how i would be coming in she moved my appointment to the last slot of the day because she said it would take too long and she didnt want to mess up the schedules i felt like that was disrespectful of my time and made me feel like a burden that had to moved to the last possible slot to accommodate them

the second appointment i made to get my hair straightened again one week later they let me know up front that it would be 65 instead of the usual 30 because my service was actually a silk press i dont think they even know the definition of a silk press as i was coming in with my hair already blown out when i questioned the price increase they told me that they just changed their policy in the last week to top it off when i didnt respond for 15h because i was working a night shift she had the audacity to say she was cancelling my appointment even though the appointment was scheduled a weekandahalf in advance and there was no urgency to receive confirmation from me this stylists name was kristen s i recommend avoiding her if you can she was incredibly unprofessional and hostile attempting to instigate an argument with me over text she must have a lot of time on her hands clearly business is slow

the stylists do a decent job on your hair but it comes at the cost of feeling marginalized and discriminated against for having a hair texture different than theirs i would strongly recommend anyone with curly or textured hair to take their money elsewhere there are many other salons to go where you will feel respected i strongly recommend personal expressions studios in haddonfield much more professional and inclusive",10,2021,18:26:15,Y
